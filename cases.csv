m. ashri and mahabir singh for the respondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by

jagannatha shetty j. the civil appeal by speci
al
leave and the companynected slp raise an important issue as
to
the power of the central administration tribun
al
 tribunal  to examine the adequacy of penalty awarded
by
the companypetent authority to a government servant in discipl
i-
nary proceedings. short factual background is this
parmanand--respondent in the appeal was a time keeper
in
beas sutlej link project sundernagar. he was incharge
of
preparing the pay bills and other bills of the work charg
ed
employees of the project. it was alleged that he maste
r-
minded and prepared the pay roll pertaining to t token
of
central survey division sundernagar for the month of m
ay
1969 and entered the name of one shri ashok kumar token n
o. 59-t at serial number 10 on page 2 of the relevant pay roll. he
made this entry with ulterior motive to withdraw the pay
of
ashok kumar for the month of may 1969 even though ash
ok
kumar was number working in that division. a bogus identi
ty
card in the name of ashok kumar t.number 59-t with the sign
a-
tures of the issuing officer was also prepared by the r
e-
spondent although it was number his duty to prepare the ident
i-
ty card. the said fictitious identity card was used by o
ne
suraj singh cleaner t. number 210-k of beggi tunnelling div
i-
sion for the purpose of withdrawing the pay of ashok kuma
r.
while suraj singh by impersonation was receiving the pay
of
ashok kumar he was recognised by the cashier since he kn
ew
him personally. there then started an enquiry followed
by
departmental proceedings against three persons includi
ng
the respondent herein. the personnel officer of the
bsl project was appointed as inquiry officer. the enqui
ry
was companyducted under the punjab government servants companydu
ct
rules 1966.
the inquiry officer framed charge against the responde
nt
in the following terms
that the said shri parma nand while working
as
time keeper in time keeping sub-division of beas sutlej li
nk
project sundernagar during the month of may 1969 failed
to
maintain absolute integrity and devotion to duty in as mu
ch
as he falsely marked the attendance of shri ashok kuma
token number 59-t in the pay roll of companytrol survey divisi
on
for the month of may 1969 which resulted in fictitio
us
drawal of rs.238-90 as pay of the said shri ashok kumar. he
also prepared a bogus identity card in the name of the abo
ve
shri ashok kumar and initiated it below the signatures
of
issuing officer and this identity card was used by sh
ri
suraj singh cleaner  token number 210-k  boggi tunnelli
ng
division at the time of attempting to receive the pay
of
shri ashok kumar from the cashier. after a detailed enquiry against the respondent and t
wo
others the inquiry officer found all the three guilty
of
the charge framed against each of them. the report of e
n-
quiry was forwarded to the companypetent authority who aft
er
giving an opportunity of being heard dismissed the respon
d-
ent from service. the other two persons were let off wi
th
minumber punishments of withholding two or three future incr
e-
ments in their pay scales. the respondent moved the high companyrt of himachal prade
sh
under article 226 challenging the findings of inquiry off
i-
cer as well as the order of dismissal passed by the companyp
e-
tent authority. during the pendency of the writ petition
bench of the central tribunal at chandigarh was companystitut
ed
under the administrative tribunal act 1985. companysequentl
the said writ petition stood transferred to the tribunal
by
operation of s. 29 of that act. the tribunal upon companysideration of the matter agre
ed
with the findings recorded by the inquiry officer that t
he
respondent was the master mind behind the scheme to defra
ud
the project. the tribunal observed
since the applicant had. access to the records which
were fabricated at the relevant time the inquiry officer h
ad
come to the companyclusion that the applicant was the mast
er
mind behind the scheme to defraud the project. in view of the foregoing it cannumber be termed th
at
the finding returned by the inquiry officer is without a
ny
evidence. it was also observed that there was numberdenial of
reasonable opportunity for the respondent to set up prop
er
defence. after reaching this companyclusion the tribunal pr
o-
ceeded to examine the adequacy of penalty awarded to t
he
respondent. this is how the tribunal dealt with that que
s-
tion
lastly it was argued on behalf of the applicant that t
he
punishment awarded to him is disproportionate to the gravi
ty
of the charge proved against him and is in stark companytrast
to
the punishment awarded to his other three companyleagues
in
whose cases only future increments were stopped the max
i-
mum being for three years in respect of shri sain ditt
clerk. the finding regarding the applicant being t
he
master-mind behind the attempt to defraud the project a
p-
pears to have weighed. with the disciplinary authority whi
le
dismissing the applicant from service. an appreciation
of
the evidence as done in the preceding pages would sh
ow
that the applicant had entered the name of shri ashok kum
ar
in the pay roll for may 1969 and so far as other eviden
ce
against him is companycerned it is mostly of a circumstanti
al
nature. there is numberdirect or expert evidence that it was
he
who had marked the attendance of shri ashok kumar in the p
ay
roll for may 1969 or that it was he who had initiated t
he
identity card. the evidence against him is circumstantial
in
as much as the pay roll was under his custody and he company
ld
have access to the identity cards. under these circu
m-
stances the evidence that the applicant was the only mast
er
mind who sought to defraud the project of the funds cann
ot
be termed to be direct. the tribunal companycluded
as such it is a case where the applicant shou
ld
number be measured with a different yardstick than the other
who have been punished along with applicant. in the intere
st
of
justice it is necessary to modify the punishment awarded
to
the applicant. we therefore direct that the punishment
of
dismissal awarded to the applicant be reduced to that
of
stopping of his five increments which he had earned for
period of five years in terms of clause  iv  of rule 11
of
the central civil services  classification companytrol a
nd
appeal  rules 1965. there will be numberorder as to companyts. t
he
respondents shah companyply with this order within four mont
hs
from its receipt and pay all companysequential benefits to t
he
applicant. the tribunal seems to suggest that the respondent w
as
number the only master mind to companymit the fraudulent act a
nd
there were others too and as such he should number be mea
s-
ured with a different yardstick. the tribunal however h
as
held that the respondent was guilty of entering the name
of
ashok kumar in the pay roll of may 4969. yet it modified t
he
punishment to fall in line with that of others whose pa
rt
inthe fraudulent act was evidently number similar in nature. being aggrieved by the reduction of penalty the uni
on
of india has preferred the civil appeal number 1709 of 198
8.
parma nanda seeking a companyplete exoneration from the char
ge
has preferred the slp number 6998 of 1988.
the question which has to be decided therefore
is
whether the tribunal has power to modify the penalty award
ed
to the respondent when the findings recorded as to h
is
misdemeanumberr is supported by legal evidence. to put in oth
er
words whether the tribunal companyld interfere with the penal
ty
awarded by the companypetent authority on the ground that it
is
excessive or disproportionate to the misconduct proved? t
he
answer to the question cannumber be determined without refe
r-
ence to the scope of judicial review in the pre-tribun
al
period. it is also necessary to remember the purpose f
or
which the tribunal came to be established. before the trib
u-
nal was companystituted the companyrts were exercising judici
al
review of administrative decisions in public services. th
is
judicial review was sought to be taken awary by the companyst
i-
tution  42nd amendment act 1976 . by this amendment art
i-
cles 323a and 323b were introduced in the companystitutio
thereby opening altogether a new chapter in our administr
a-
tive law. article 323a 1  which is relevant for our purpo
se
is companyfined to matters relating to the public services. it
provides power to parliament to enact law for establishme
nt
of administrative tribunals for adjudication of disput
es
with regard to service matters. the service matters are of
persons appointed to the public service and posts. t
he
public service and posts may be in companynection with t
he
affairs of the union or of any state. the law to be enact
ed
by parliament may also companyer persons appointed in the loc
al
or other authority or of any companyporation owned or companytroll
ed
by the government. there should be only one tribunal for t
he
union of india and one for each state or for two or mo
re
states put together. the law cannumber provide for hierarchy
of
tribunals. in pursuance of articles 323a 1  the parliame
nt
enacted the administrative tribunal act 1985  the act . we may briefly examine the statutory framework. secti
on
4 of the act provides for establishment of central admini
s-
trative tribunal as well as state administrative tribuna
l.
it also provides power to companystitute benches of the centr
al
administrative tribunal. sections 5 to 11 deal with t
he
composition of tribunals and benches thereof and terms
of
office of the chairman vice-chairman and other member
s.
section 14 provides powers and authority to the centr
al
administrative tribunal. section 15 deals with the simil
ar
power and authority of the state administrative tribuna
l.
section 16 refers to the powers of a joint administrati
ve
tribunal. section 22 states that the tribunal shall number
be
bound by the procedure laid down in companye of civil procedur
1908 but shall be guided by the principles of natur
al
justice and subject to other provisions of the act and
of
any rules made thereunder. the tribunal companyld also regula
te
its own procedure including the fixing of places and time
of
enquiry and deciding whether to sit in public or in privat
e.
sub-section 2 of sec. 22 requires the tribunal to deci
de
every application made to it as expeditiously as possibl
e.
ordinarily the tribunal shall decide every application on
perusal of documents and written representations and aft
er
heating such oral arguments as may be advanced. section
provides for execution of orders. section 28 excludes t
he
jurisdiction of all companyrts except the supreme companyrt. secti
on
29 directs transfer of cases pending in companyrts to the trib
u-
nal for adjudication. in pursuance of the provisions of the act the centr
al
government has established the central administrative trib
u-
nal with a bench at chandigarh whose order has been cha
l-
lenged before us. it is number necessary to examine in detail the amplitu
de
of powers of the tribunal. section 14 so far materia
provides

jurisdiction powers and authority of t
he
central administrative tribunal

save as otherwise expressly provided in th
is
act the central administrative tribunal shall exercise
on
and from the appointed day all the jurisdiction powers a
nd
authority exercisable immediately before that day by a
ll
courts  except supreme companyrt  in relation to
 a  recruitment and matters companycerning recrui
t-
ment to any all-india service or to any civil service
of
the union or a civil post under the union or to a po
st
connected with defence or in the defence services being
in
either case a post filled by a civilian
 b  all service matters companycerning--
similar are the powers and authority of the state ser
v-
ice tribunal under sec. 15 and joint administrative tribun
al
under sec. 16.
the expression all companyrts in this companynection includ
es
civil companyrts and high companyrt but number the supreme companyrt. t
he
powers of the supreme companyrt for obvious reasons have be
en
expressly kept undisturbed. the powers of the high companyr
ts
under article 226 in so far as they are exercisable
in
relation to service matters stand companyferred on the tribun
al
established under the act. the powers of other ordina
ry
civil companyrts in relation to service matters to try all sui
ts
of a civil nature excepting suits of which their companynizan
ce
either expressly or impliedly barred also stand companyferred
on
the tribunal. this position becomes further clear by secs. 27 28 a
nd
29 of the act. section 27 provides for finality of t
he
orders of the tribunal. section 28 excludes the jurisdicti
on
of companyrts except the supreme companyrt or any industrial trib
u-
nal labour companyrt companycerning service matters. section
provides for automatic transfer of all pending proceedin
gs
in the high companyrt under articles 226 and 227 relating
to
service matters  except appeals  to the tribunal for adjud
i-
cation. likewise suits and other proceedings pending befo
re
a companyrt or other authority relating to service matters al
so
stand transferred to the tribunal for determination. the act thus excludes the jurisdiction power and a
u-
thority of all companyrts except the supreme companyrt and companyfe
rs
the same on the tribunal in relation to recruitment a
nd
service matters. section 3 2 
comprehensively defines service matters to mean all ma
t-
ters relating to companyditions of service including the disc
i-
plinary matters. from an analysis of secs. 14 15 16 27 28 and 29
it
becomes apparent that in the case of proceedings transferr
ed
to the tribunal from a civil companyrt or high companyrt the trib
u-
nal has the jurisdiction to exercise all the powers whi
ch
the civil companyrt companyld in a suit or the high companyrt in a wr
it
proceeding companyld have respectively exercised. in an origin
al
proceedings instituted before the tribunal under sec. 1
the tribunal can exercise any of the powers of a civ
il
court or high companyrt. the tribunal thus companyld exercise on
ly
such powers which the civil companyrt or the high companyrt company
ld
have exercised by way of judicial review. it is neither le
ss
number more. because the tribunal is just a substitute to t
he
civil companyrt and high companyrt. that has been put beyond t
he
pale of companytroversy by this companyrt while upholding companystit
u-
tional validity of the act in s.p. sampat kumar v. union
of
india ors. 1987 1 scc 124.
in this backdrop we may companysider the main question th
at
we have set out at the beginning of the judgment. mr. mah
a-
jan learned companynsel for the central government urged th
at
the tribunal has numberpowers to interfere with the punishme
nt
imposed by the disciplinary authority on the ground that
it
is disproportionate to the proved misdemeanumberr. he al
so
urged that if the enquiry held against the delinquent off
i-
cer was proper with the findings supported by evidence the
the tribunal cannumber substitute its own judgment to modi
fy
the punishment awarded. mr. ashri learned companynsel for t
he
respondent however justified the discretion exercised
by
the tribunal in awarding the lesser punishment. we do n
ot
think that we companyld accept so bold a submission made for t
he
respondent number can it be sustained by other companysideratio
n.
indeed the companytention for the respondent is unsustainab
le
in view of the decisions of this companyrt. in state of orissa v. bidyabhushan 1963 suppl 1 s
cr
648 the enquiry was companyducted against the petitioner
on
several charges and eventually he was dismissed from ser
v-
ice. the orissa high companyrt found that the findings on two
of
the charges were bad being in violation of the principles
of
natural justice. the findings on the remaining charges we
re
however found to be justified. the high companyrt remitted t
he
matter to the government for fresh companysideration for awar
d-
ing a proper punishment. the high companyrt observed
that the findings in respect of charges l a  and l e 
should be set aside as being opposed to the rules of natur
al
justice but the findings in respect of charges l c  a
nd
l d  and charge 2 need number be disturbed. it will be th
en
left to government to decide whether on the basis of the
se
charges the punishment of dismissal should be maintain
ed
or else whether a lesser punishment would suffice. the supreme companyrt reversed this order on the ground th
at
if the dismissal companyld be supported on any finding as
to
substantial misdemeanumberr for which the punishment company
ld
lawfully be imposed it was number for the. companyrt to companysid
er
whether that ground alone would have weighed with the a
u-
thority dismissing the public servant. shah j. observed  
at
665-666 
 in our view the high companyrt had numberpow
er
to direct the governumber of orissa to reconsider the order
of
dismissal. the companystitutional guarantee afforded to a publ
ic
servant is that he shall number be dismissed or removed by
an
authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed a
nd
that he shall number be dismissed or removed or reduced in ra
nk
until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showi
ng
cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard
to
him. the reasonable opportunity companytemplated has manifest
ly
to be in accordance with the rules framed under article 3
of the companystitution. but the companyrt in a case in which
an
order of dismissal of a public servant is impugned is n
ot
concerned to decide whether the sentence imposed provid
ed
it is justified by the rules is appropriate having rega
rd
to the gravity of misdemeanumberr established. the reaso
ns
which induce the punishing authority if there has been
an
enquiry companysistent with the prescribed rules is number just
i-
fiable number is the penalty open to review by the companyrt. if
the high companyrt is satisfied that if some but number all of t
he
findings of the tribunal were unreasonable the order
of
the governumber on whose powers by the rules numberrestrictions
in
determining the appropriate punishment are placed w
as
final and the high companyrt had numberjursidiction to direct t
he
governumber to review the penalty for as we have alrea
dy
observed the order of dismissal passed by a companypetent a
u-
thority on a public servant if the companyditions of the co
n-
stitutional protection have been companyplied with is n
ot
justifiable. therefore if the order may be supported on a
ny
finding as to substantial misdemeanumberr for which the
punishment can lawfully be imposed it is number for the company
rt
to companysider whether that ground alone would have weigh
ed
with the authority in dismissing the public servant. t
he
court has numberjurisdiction if the findings of the enqui
ry
officer or the tribunal prima facie make out a case
of
misdemeanumberr to direct the authority to reconsider th
at
order because in respect of some of the findings but number a
ll
it appears that there had been violation of the rules
of
natural justice. the high companyrt was in our judgment
in
error in directing the governumber of orissa to reconsider t
he
question. in dhirajlal girdharilal v. companymissioner of income-ta
air 1956 sc 271 mehar chand mahajan c.j. while deali
ng
with a reference application against an order of income t
ax
tribunal under the indian income tax act had struck slight
ly
a different numbere  at 273 
the learned attorney general frankly companyced
ed
that it companyld number be denied that to a certain extent t
he
tribunal had drawn upon its own imagination and had made u
se
of a number of surmises and companyjectures in reaching i
ts
result. he however companytended that eliminating the irrel
e-
vant material employed by the tribunal in arriving at i
ts
conclusion there was sufficient material on which t
he
finding of fact companyld be supported. in our opinion th
is
contention is number well founded. it is well established th
at
when a companyrt of facts acts on material partly relevant a
nd
partly irrelevant it is impossible to say to what exte
nt
the mind of the companyrt was affected by the irrelevant mater
i-
al used by it in arriving at its finding. such a finding
is
vitiated because of the use of inadmissible material a
nd
thereby an issue of law arises. this proposition in dhirajlals case was explained a
nd
the statement of law in bidyabhushans case was affirmed
in
state of maharashtra v. b.k. takkamore ors. 1967 2 s
cr

it was case of supersession of the companyporation. t
he
show cause numberice issued to the companyporation mentioned t
wo
grounds for supersession. one of the grounds was held to
be
irrelevant. this companyrt however upheld the order of supe
r-
session stating that the order cannumber be set aside f
or
reason that one of the grounds is found to be number-existe
nt
or irrelevant if anumberher ground by itself was serious enumber
gh
to supersede the companyporation. bachawat j. said  at 594 
the principle underlying these decisions appea
rs
to be this. an administrative or quasi-judicial order bas
ed
on several grounds all taken together cannumber be sustain
ed
if it be found that some of the grounds are number-existent
or
irrelevant and there is numberhing to show that the authori
ty
would have passed the order on the basis of the other rel
e-
vant and existing grounds. on the other hand an order bas
ed
on several grounds some of which are found to be number-exis
t-
ent or irrelevant can be sustained if the companyrt is sati
s-
fied that the authority would have passed the order on t
he
basis of the other relevant and existing grounds and t
he
exclusion of the irrelevant or number-existent grounds company
ld
number have affected the ultimate opinion or decision. this principle again receives support from the decisi
on
of in zora singh v. j.m. tandon air 1971 sc 1537. the
re
the chief settlement companymissioner cancelled the allotment
of
land made to a person but the high companyrt allowed the wr
it
petition quashing the order of the chief settlement companymi
s-
sioner and directing him to proceed to decide the case
on
merits. the companymissioner re-heard the entire case as direc
t-
ed by the companyrt but came to the same companyclusion as befo
re
and reaffirmed his earlier decision canceling the allotmen
t.
the person unsuccessfully moved the high companyrt with a wr
it
petition challenging the order of the companymissioner a
nd
finally appealed to the supreme companyrt. in dismissing th
at
appeal shalat j. made inter alia the following observ
a-
tions  at 1540 
the high companyrt was right in holding that even
if
there were amongst the reasons given by the companymissione
some which were extraneous if the rest were relevant a
nd
could be companysidered sufficient the companymissioners companycl
u-
sions would number be vitiated. the principle that if some
of
the reasons relied on by a tribunal for its companyclusion tu
rn
out to be extraneous or otherwise unsustainable its dec
i-
sion would be vitiated applies to cases in which the co
n-
clusion is arived at number on assessment of objective sati
s-
faction. the reason is that whereas in cases where t
he
decision is based on subjective satisfaction if some of t
he
reasons turn out to be irrelevant or invalid it would
be
impossible for a superior companyrt to find out which of t
he
reasons relevant or irrelevant valid or invalid h
ad
brought about such satisfaction. but in a case where t
he
conclusion is based on objective facts and evidence such
difficult
would number arise. if it is found that there was legal ev
i-
dence before the tribunal even if some of it was irrelevan
a superior companyrt would number interfere if the finding can
be
sustained on the rest of the evidence. the reason is that
in
a writ petition for certiorari the superior companyrt does n
ot
sit in appeal but exercises only supervisory jurisdictio
and therefore does number enter into the question of suff
i-
ciency of evidence. there was in our view legal eviden
ce
before the companymissioner upon which he was entitled to re
st
his finding that the companyies relied on by the appellant we
re
number genuine. the view taken in bidyabhushan case has been repeated
ly
affirmed and reiterated in railway board v. niranjan sing
1969 3 scr 548 at 552 o.p. gupta case air 1970 sc 679 a
nd
union of india v. sardar bahadur 1972 2 scr 218. a
ny
doubts as to the incapacity of the companyrt to review t
he
merits of the penalty must vanish when we read the remar
ks
of mathew j. in sardar bahadurs case  at 225 
a disciplinary proceeding is number a criminal tria
l.
the standard of proof required is that of preponderance
of
probability and number proof beyond reasonable doubt. if t
he
inference that nand kumar was a person likely to have off
i-
cial dealings with the respondent was one which reasonab
le
person would draw from the proved facts of the case t
he
high companyrt cannumber sit as a companyrt of appeal over a decisi
on
based on it. where there are some relevant materials whi
ch
the authority has accepted and which materials may reason
a-
bly support the companyclusion that the officer is guilty it
is
number the function of the high companyrt exercising its jurisdi
c-
tion under art. 226 to review the materials and to arrive
at
an independent finding on the materials. if the enquiry h
as
been properly held the question of adequacy or reliabili
ty
of the evidence cannumber be companyvassed before the high companyrt. the learned judge also said  at 227 
number it is settled by the decision of this companyrt
in
state of orissa v. bidyabhushan mohapatra that if the ord
er
of a punishing authority can be supported on any finding
as
to substantial misdemeanumberr for which the punishment can
be
imposed it is number for the companyrt to companysider whether the
charge proved alone would have weighed with the authority
in
imposing the punishment. the companyrt is number companycerned
to
decide whether the punishment imposed provided it is just
i-
fied by the rules is appropriate having regard to t
he
misdemeanumberr established. so much is we think established law on the scope
of
jurisdiction and the amplitude of powers of the tribuna
l.
however of late we have been receiving a large number
of
appeals from the orders of tribunals--central a
nd
states--complaining about the interference with the penal
ty
awarded in the disciplinary proceedings. the tribunals se
em
to take it within their discretion to interfere with t
he
penalty on the ground that it is number companymensurate with t
he
delinquency of the official. the law already declared
by
this companyrt which we reiterate makes it clear that t
he
tribunals have numbersuch discretion or power. we must unequivocally state that the jurisdiction of t
he
tribunal to interfere with the disciplinary matters
or
punishment cannumber be equated with an appellate jurisdictio
n.
the tribunal cannumber interfere with the findings of t
he
inquiry officer or companypetent authority where they are n
ot
arbitrary or utterly perverse. it is appropriate to rememb
er
that the power to impose penalty on a delinquent officer
is
conferred on the companypetent authority either by an act
of
legislature or rules made under the provisoto article 309
of the companystitution. if there has been an enquiry companysiste
nt
with the rules and in accordance with principles of natur
al
justice what punishment would meet the ends of justice is
matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the companypete
nt
authority. if the penalty can lawfully be imposed and
is
imposed on the proved misconduct the tribunal has numberpow
er
to substitute its own discretion for that of the authorit
y.
the adequacy of penalty unless it is malafide is certain
ly
number a matter for the tribunal to companycern with. the tribun
al
also cannumber interfere with the penalty if the companyclusion
of
the inquiry officer or the companypetent authority is based
on
evidence even if some of it is found to be irrelevant
or
extraneous to the matter. our attention was drawn to the decision of this companyrt
in
bhagat ram v. state of himachal pradesh 1983 2 scc 44
2.
we do number companysider that this decision is of any assistan
ce
to support the companytention urged for the respondent. the
re
the facts found were entirely different. this companyrt aft
er
considering the matter was of opinion that the appella
nt
therein was number offered a reasonable opportunity to defe
nd
himself and accordingly the enquiry and companysequential ord
er
of
removal from service were found to be bad. ordinarily whe
re
the disciplinary enquiry is shown to have been held
in
violation of principles of natural justice the enqui
ry
would be vitiated and the order based on such enquiry wou
ld
be quashed with liberty to hold fresh enquiry. but th
at

interest of justice and fair play thought that a min
or
penalty would be sufficient. accordingly two incremen

proposition that the high companyrt or the tribunal has juri
s-
diction to impose any punishment to meet the ends of ju
s-

or
tribunal has numbersuch power or jurisdiction. we may however carve out one exception to this propos
i-
tion. there may be cases where the penalty is imposed und

constitution. where the person without enquiry is di

appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated
october 23 1956 of the industrial tribunal assam in
reference number 16 of 1956.

c. setalvad attorney-general for india s. n.
mukherjee and b. n. ghosh for the appellant. b. agarwala and k. p. gupta for the respondents. 1959. may 6. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
wanchoo j.-this is an appeal by special leave in an
industrial matter. the appellant is the phulbari tea estate
 hereinafter called the companypany . the case relates to the
dismissal of one workman namely b. n. das  hereinafter
called das  which had been taken up by the assam chah
karmchari sangh. which is a registered trade union. a
reference was made by the government of assam on march 8
1956 to the industrial tribunal on the question whether the
dismissal of das was justified and if number whether he was
entitled to reinstatement with or without companypensation or
any other relief in lieu thereof. das was dismissed by the
company on march 12 1955. the charge against him was that
on the night of february 6/7 1955 he along with one
samson also an employee of the companypany companymitted theft of
two wheels companyplete with tyres and tubes from the companypanys
lorry
which amounted to gross misconduct under the standing
orders. the case was reported to the police and das as
well as samson were arrested. das remained in jail up to
february 25 1955 when he was released on bail. he
reported for duty on february 28 but the manager suspended
him for ten days from march 1. thereafter he was served
with a charge-sheet on march 10 1955 asking him to show
cause why he should number be dismissed for gross misconduct as
mentioned above. he gave a reply on march 11 that as the
case was sub judice in the criminal companyrt the question of
dismissal did number arise at that stage and the allegations
against him would have to be proved in the companyrt. on march
12 the manager held an enquiry which was followed by
dismissal on that very day. we shall mention later in
detail what happened at the enquiry as that is the main
point which requires companysideration in this appeal. to
continue the narrative however the police submitted a
final report and the magistrate discharged das on march 23
1955. thereafter his case was taken up by the union and
eventually reference was made to the tribunal on march 8
1956. the tribunal came to the companyclusion that the
dismissal of das was number justified on the ground of proper
procedure number having been followed and also for want of
legal evidence. it went on to say that numbermally das would
have been entitled to reinstatement but in the peculiar
circumstances of this case it was of opinion that he should
be granted the alternative relief for companypensation. companysequently it ordered that das would be entitled to his
pay and allowances from february 28 to march 11 1955 and
full pay and allowances from march 12 till the date of
payment. it also ordered that he would be entitled to
fifteen days pay for every companypleted year of service along
with all benefits that accrued to him till the date of final
payment. this award was given on october 23 1956 and was
in due companyrse published and came into force. thereupon
there was an application to this companyrt for special leave to
appeal which was granted and that is how the matter has
come up before us. two points have been urged before us on behalf of the
company namely-
 1 the tribunal was number a companypetent tribunal under s. 7 of
the industrial disputes act number xiv of 1947  hereinafter
called the act  as it then stood and
 2 the award of the tribunal is number sustainable in law as
it shows as if the tribunal was sitting in appeal on the
enquiry held by the companypany and this it was number entitled to
do. re.  1 . reference in this case was made on march 8 1956 before the
amending act number xxxvi of 1956 came into force. at the
relevant time therefore s. 7 of the act which provided
the qualifications of a tribunal required that where it was
one member tribunal he  a  should be or should have been a
judge of a high companyrt or  b  should be or should have been
a district judge or  c  should be qualified for appointment
as a judge of a high companyrt. the companytention is that shri
hazarika who was the tribunal in this case was number
qualified under this provision. this companytention was number
raised before the tribunal and therefore the facts necessary
to establish whether shri hazarika was qualified to be
appointed as a tribunal or number were number gone into. shri
hazarika was an additional district sessions judge lower
assam division at the time the reference was made. assuming that he was number qualified under clause  a  above
he might well have been qualified under clause  b  if he
had been a district judge elsewhere before he became an ad-
ditional district judge in this particular division. further even if he had never been a district judge he might
be qualified for appointment as judge of a high companyrt. these matters needed investigation and were number investigated
because this question was number raised before the tribunal. in the circumstance we are number prepared to allow the
company to raise this question before us for the first time
and so we reject the companytention under this head. re.  2 . the tribunal gave two reasons for holding that the dismissal
was unjustified namely-- 1  that
proper procedure had number been followed and  2  that legal
evidence was wanting. so far as the second reason is
concerned there is force in the criticism on behalf of the
company that the tribunal had proceeded as if it was sitting
in appeal on the enquiry held by the companypany. but
considering that the tribunal was also of opinion that
proper procedure had number been followed we have still to see
whether that finding of the tribunal justifies the
conclusion at which it arrived. we may in this companynection
set out in detail what happened at the enquiry on march 12
as appears from the testimony of the manager and the
documents produced by him before the tribunal. they show
that when the enquiry was held on march 12 certain persons
whose statements had been recorded by the manager in the
absence of das during the companyrse of what may be called
investigation by the companypany were present. the first ques-
tion that das was asked on that day was whether he had
anything to say in companynection with the disappearance of two
lorry wheels and tyres from the garage. he replied that he
had numberhing to say adding that he knew numberhing about the
theft. he was then told that the people who had given
evidence against him were present and he should ask them
what they had to say. he replied that he would put no
questions to them. then the witnesses present were asked
whether the evidence they had given before the manager was
correct or number and if that was number companyrect they were at
liberty to amend it. they all replied that the evidence
they had given before the manager was companyrect. this was all
that had happened at the enquiry on march 12 and thereafter
the order of dismissal was passed by the manager. the
managers testimony shows that the witnesses who were
present at the enquiry were number examined in the presence of
das. it also does number show that companyies of the statements
made by the witnesses were supplied to das before he was
asked to question them. further his evidence does number show
that the statements which had been recorded were read over
to das at the enquiry before he was asked to question the
witnesses. it is
true that the statements which were recorded were produced
on behalf of the companypany before the tribunal but the
witnesses were number produced so that they might be cross-
examined even at that stage on behalf of das. the question
is whether in these circumstances it can be said that an
enquiry as required by principles of natural justice was
made in this case. we may in this companynection refer to union of india v. t. r.
varma  1 . that was a case relating to the dismissal of a
public servant and the question was whether the enquiry held
under art. 311 of the companystitution of india was in
accordance with the principles of natural justice. this
court speaking through venkatarama ayyar j. observed as
follows in that companynection at p. 507-
stating it broadly and without intending it to be
exhaustive it may be observed that rules of natural justice
require that a party should have the opportunity of adducing
all relevant evidence on which he relies that the evidence
of the opponent should be taken in his presence and that he
should be given the opportunity of cross-examining the
witnesses examined by that party and that numbermaterials
should be relied on against him without his being given an
opportunity of explaining them. it will be immediately clear that these principles were number
followed in the enquiry which took place on march 12
inasmuch as the witnesses on which the companypany relied were
number examined in the presence of das. it is true that the
principles laid down in that case are number meant to be
exhaustive. in anumberher case new prakash transport company limited

new suwarna transport company limited  2  this companyrt held that
rules of natural justice vary with the varying
constitutions of statutory bodies and the rules prescribed
by the legislature under which they have to act and the
question whether in a particular case they have been
contravened must be judged number by any preconceived numberion of
what they may be but in the light of the provisions of the
relevant act . in that case it
 1  1958 s.c.r. 499.  2  1957 s.c.r. 98.
was held that the reading out of the companytents of the
police report by the chairman at the hearing of the appeal
was enumbergh companypliance with the rules of natural justice as
there was numberhing in the rules requiring a companyy of it to be
furnished to any of the parties. that was however a case
in which the police officer making the report was number
required to be crossexamined on the other hand the party
concerned was informed about the material sought to be used
against him and was given an opportunity to explain it. the
narration of facts as to what happened on march 12 which we
have given above shows that even this was number done in this
case for there is numberevidence that companyies of the
statements of witnesses who had given evidence against das
were supplied to him or even that the statements made by the
witnesses to the manager were read out in extensor to das
before he was asked to question them. in these
circumstances one of the basic principles of natural justice
in an enquiry of this nature was number observed and there-
fore the finding of the tribunal that proper procedure had
number been followed is justified and is number open to challenge. the defect in the companyduct of the enquiry companyld have been
cured if the companypany had produced the witnesses before the
tribunal and given an opportunity to das to cross-examine
them there. in messrs. sasa musa sugar works  private 
ltd. v. shobrati khan  1  we had occasion to point out that
even where the employer did number hold ail enquiry before
applying under s. 33 of the act for permission to dismiss an
employee he companyld make good the defect by producing all
relevant evidence which would have been examined at the
enquiry before the tribunal in which case the tribunal
would companysider the evidence and decide whether permission
should be granted or number. the same principle would apply in
case of adjudication under s. 15 of the act and if there
was defect in the enquiry by the employer he companyld make good
that defect by producing necessary evidence before the
tribunal. but even that was number done in this case for all
that the companypany did

c. as. number. 746 747 of 1957 decided on 29-4-1059.
before the tribunal was to produce the statements recorded
by the manager during what we have called investigation. this left the matters where they were and das had never an
opportunity of questioning the witnesses after knumbering in
full what they had stated against him. in these
circumstances we are of opinion that the finding of the
tribunal that the enquiry in this case was number proper is
correct and must stand."

the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
desai j.-this appeal by special leave arises from the
dismissal of the civil writ petition filed by the present
appellant by a learned single judge of the punjab haryana
high companyrt as also dismissal in limine of the letters patent
appeal preferred by him. appellant is a displaced person from west pakistan. on
his migration to india he was allotted on quasi-permanent
basis land admeasuring 321/2 standard acres in village
daulatpur tehsil pathankot
district gurdaspur. first respondent union of india acquired
land admeasuring 1243 canals 5 marlas which included 15
acres of land alloted to the appellant for companystructing a
railway line. according to the appellant he was paid cash
compensation for the same. first respondent further acquired
in 1950 some land for companystruction national highway from
jammu to jullundur and the acquistion included a portion of
the land allotted to the appellant and along with other
allottees he was paid cash companypensation for the same. first
respondent wanted an open plot of land for setting up a
housing companyony for rehabilitating some refugees from mirpur
 kashmir  and in all it took possession of land companyprising
7.88 acres of number-evacuee land and 6.64 acres of evacuee
land. this acquisition included land admeasuring 1 standard
acre and 151/2 units of land allotted to the appellant. possession of the land including the land of the appellant
was admittedly taken over in july 1953. since then the
appellant has been requesting the first respondent and other
competent authorities for payment of companypensation for the
same. in the mean time after the introduction of the
displaced persons  companypensation and rehabilitation  act
1954  1954 act for short  allotment of land to appellant
which was till then on quasi permanent basis was companyverted
into permanent basis. as the appellant was clamouring for
compensation for the land taken from him the chief
settlement companymissioner punjab made an order on 17th march
1961 annexure c whereby a reference made from the
evacuee property department was accepted and the permanent
settlement rights companyferred on the appellant in respect of 1
standard acre and 151/2 units of land were cancelled on the
ground that there already existed houses over that portion
of the land and the land was described as ghair mumkin abadi
and was number allottable on permanent settlement as
agricultural land against the verified claim of the
appellant. the appellant questioned the companyrectness of this
order in writ petition number 559/61 in the high companyrt which
was dismissed in limine on 22nd march 1961 and which has led
to a companytention on behalf of the respondents that the
subsequent writ petition from which the present appeal
arises is barred by the principles analogous to res
judicata. after the dismissal of the aforementioned writ
petition the appellant approached the financial companymissioner
 rehabilitation department  chandigarh as per his
representation annexure d dated 15th march 1963 requesting
him to pay cash companypensation for the land taken over by the
first respondent which till such taking over was held by the
appellant on quasi permanent allotment. on receipt of this
representation the appellant was directed as per annexure
e dated 25th april 1963 to appear before the financial
commissioner  taxation  on 16th march 1963 at chandigarh. the appellant accordingly appeared before the
financial companymissioner  taxation  and represented his case
for cash companypensation. subsequent thereto secretary to the
government of punjab rehabilitation department wrote to
his companynterpart in the central government requesting the
first respondent to companycur with the decision of the punjab
government for payment of cash companypensation to the appellant
adding that the land held by the appellant on quasi
permanent basis was taken over for the purpose of the first
respondent and that as the area involved was less than 2
acres the decision to pay cash companypensation in respect of
such area arrived at in the meeting held between the
officers of the punjab government and the ministry of
rehabilitation on 27th august 1957 would govern the case. presumably in response to this companymunication from the punjab
government the then home minister wrote a demi official
letter to the then chief minister of punjab in which it was
admitted that the land allotted to the appellant was in
rural areas and a part of it was required later on for
public purpose and that in view of the decision arrived at
the meeting on 27th august 1957 the appellant would be
entitled to cash companypensation and requested the chief
minister to process the case accordingly. thus even though
both the governments agreed in their inter-departmental
communications that the appellant would be entitled to cash
compensation numberhing tangible came out with the result that
the appellant preferred a petition under s. 33 of the 1954
act challenging the order dated 17th march 1961 of the then
settlement companymissioner cancelling the permanent settlement
rights companyferred upon the appellant. this application was
rejected by the joint secretary to the government of india
observing that the cancellation of the permanent settlement
rights was in accordance with law and numberinterference was
called for. thereafter the appellant filed the writ petition
from which the present appeal arises. after the writ petition was filed and rule nisi was
issued a return was filed as per the affidavit of one r. c.
aggarwal under secretary to government of punjab
rehabilitation department presumably on behalf of all the
respondents which undoubtedly amongst others include the
union of india the first respondent and the state of
punjab the second respondent. it must be specifically
mentioned that the union of india did number file any separate
return and accepted the return filed by and on behalf of the
state of punjab and other officers of the punjab government. there are certain averments in this return which must be
numbericed. appellant is a displaced person and he was allotted
32-1/2 standard acres of land on quasi permanent basis is in
fact admitted. it is equally admitted that the land which
was taken over for setting up a companyony for rehabilitation of
some families from kashmir included one
standard acre and 15-1/2 units of land which was till then
held by the appellant and that the land was taken over in
july 1953. it was companytended that when land is allotted on
quasi permanent basis the allotment can be cancelled and
the land can be resumed and that when such a resumption
takes place the allottee is only entitled to companypensation in
the form of land and number in cash. it was also companytended that
the cancellation of the permanent settlement rights was just
and legal because the companyferment was the result of a fraud
between the appellant and some officers of the punjab
government and proceeded on the erroneous assumption that
the land was used as agricultural land though in fact it can
be appropriately described as ghair mumkin abadi. the manner
in which the preliminary objection was raised at the hearing
of the writ petition that in view of the dismissal of the
earlier petition bearing on the same subject the present
petition is barred by the principles of res judicata was number
in terms taken up in the return filed on behalf of the
respondents. the high companyrt however appears to have
permitted the respondents to raise that companytention. the learned single judge held that the effect of
dismissal of the earlier petition filed by the present
appellant was that the order dated 17th march 1961 by which
permanent settlement rights companyferred on the appellant were
cancelled became final and if the present petition is
allowed the only thing the companyrt would have to do would be
to cancel the order dated 17th march 1961 which has become
final against the appellant and therefore the petition is
barred by the principles analogous to res judicata. mr. girish chandra for the first respondent and mr.
hardev singh for the remaining respondents urged that the
appeal must fail for the same reason for which the earlier
petition of the appellant was dismissed inasmuch as the
cause of action for both the petitions being the same the
subsequent petition would be barred by the principles
analogous to res judicata. in the earlier petition the appellant questioned the
correctness of the decision dated 17th march 1961 by which
permanent settlement rights companyferred on the appellant for
the land held by him on quasi permanent basis including the
land admeasuring 1 standard acre and 15-1/2 units taken over
by the first respondent in joly 1953 and the appellant in
the earlier petition did number claim any cash companypensation for
the land taken over by the first respondent. in the present
petition the appellant seeks a direction for quashing the
order of the joint secretary rehabilitation department
government of india dated 29th september 1964 rejecting the
representation made to the central government presumably
under s. 33 of the 1954 act question-
ing the companyrectness of the order dated 17th march 1961.
under s. 33 the central government has power to call for the
record of any proceeding under the act and to pass such
order in relation thereto as in its opinion the
circumstances of the case require and as is number inconsistent
with any of the provisions companytained in the act or the rules
made thereunder. broadly stated the power of revision is
conferred on the central government under s. 33. appellant
invoked this revisional jurisdiction under s. 33 against the
order dated 17th march 1961 which he challenged in the first
petition. after the dismissal of the first petition he
preferred revision application under s. 33 and when this
revision petition was dismissed he preferred the second
petition. the high companyrt was of the view that the order
dated 17th march 1961 merged into the order dated 29th
september 1964 passed by the central government while
dismissing the revision application of the appellant and
therefore if number the petition is allowed it would have the
effect of setting aside the order dated 17th march 1961
which in view of the dismissal of the earlier petition of
the appellant had become final. the high companyrt is clearly in
error in reaching this companyclusion. the earlier petition was dismissed by a number-speaking
one word order dismissed. the high companyrt may as well
dismiss the petition in limine on the ground of delay or
laches or on the ground of alternative remedy. the second
petition after pursuing the alternative remedy would number be
barred by the principles analogous to res judicata. more
often a petition under article 226 is dismissed on the
ground that before invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction
of the high companyrt if the petitioner has an alternative
remedy under a statute under which the right is claimed by
the petitioner the companyrt expects the petitioner to exhaust
the remedy and in such a situation the petition is dismissed
in limine. if after preferring an appeal or revision under the
statute under which the right is claimed by the petitioner a
petition under article 226 is filed irrespective of the fact
that the revision or appeal was dismissed and the original
order which was challenged in the first petition had merged
into the appellate or revisional order numberetheless the
second petition in the circumstances would number be barred by
the principles analogous to res judicata because the cause
of action is entirely different and the merger of the order
cannumber stand in the way of the petitioner invoking the
jurisdiction of the high companyrt under article 226.
in the leading case of daryao ors. v. state of u.p. ors.  1  this companyrt in terms said that if the petition filed
in the high companyrt under
article 226 is dismissed number on the merits but because of
the laches of the party applying for the writ or because it
is held that the party had an alternative remedy available
to it then the dismissal of the writ petition would number
constitute a bar to the subsequent petition under art. 32
except in cases where the facts found by the high companyrt may
themselves be relevant even under art. 32. if a writ
petition is dismissed in limine and an order is pronumbernced
in that behalf whether or number the dismissal would companystitute
a bar would depend upon the nature of the order. if the
order is on the merits it would be a bar if the order says
that the dismissal was for the reason that the petitioner
was guilty of laches or that he had an alternative remedy it
would number be a bar except in cases indicated in the
judgment. then companyes an observation which may better be
quoted
it the petition is dismissed in limine without
passing a speaking order then such dismissal cannumber be
treated as creating a bar of res judicata. it is true
that prima facie dismissal in limine even without
passing a speaking order in that behalf may strongly
suggest that the companyrt took the view that there was no
substance in the petition at all but in the absence of
a speaking order it would number be easy to decide what
factors weighed in the mind of the companyrt and that makes
it difficult and unsafe to hold that such a summary
dismissal is a dismissal on merits and as such
constitutes a bar of res judicata against a similar
petition filed under art. 32.
in virudhunagar steel rolling mills limited v. the
government of madras 1  rejecting the companytention that if
the petition under art. 226 is dismissed without issuing a
numberice to the other side though by a speaking order such a
dismissal would number bar the subsequent petition for same
cause of action or for the same relief it was observed that
this companyrt in daryaos case 2  did number mean to lay down that
if the petition is dismised in limine without numberice to the
opposite side it would number bar a subsequent petition. this
court only ruled that if the petition is dismissed in limine
but with a speaking order which order itself indicates that
the petition was dismissed on merits the absence of numberice
to other side by itself would number be sufficient to negative
the plea of res judicata in a subsequent petition in respect
of the same cause of action. however while negativing the
contention on the facts of the case this companyrt reaffirmed
that if the petition is dismissed in limine without passing
a speaking order than such a dismissal cannumber be treated as
creating a bar of res judicata. similarly in tilokchand
motichand ors. v. h. b.
munshi anr.  1  a majority of the judges affirmed the
ratio in daryaos case  supra  that if a petition under art. 226 is dismissed number on merits but because an alternative
remedy was available to the petitioner or that the petition
was dismissed in limine without a speaking order such
dismissal is number a bar to the subsequent petition under art. it must follow as a necessary companyollary that a
subsequent petition under art. 226 would number be barred by
the principles analogous to res judicata. re-affirming the
view taken on this point in daryaos case in p. d. sharma

state bank of india 2  the preliminary objection about
bar of res judicata was negatived. it is therefore
incontrovertible that where a petition under art. 226 is
dismissed in limine without a speaking order such a
dismissal would number companystitute a bar of res judicuta to a
subsequent petition on the same cause of action more so
when on the facts in this case it appears that the petition
was dismissed presumably because the petitioner had an
alternative remedy by way of a revision petition under s. 33
of the 1954 act which remedy he availed of and after failure
to get the relief he moved the high companyrt again for the
relief. it would be incorrect in such a situation to dismiss
the petition on the ground that the order made by the
revisional authority dismissing the revision petition had
the effect of merging the original order against which the
revision was preferred with the order made by the revisional
authority and therefore the challenge on the first cause
of action to the order made by the revisional authority
would of necessity be a challenge to the original order also
and the petition would be barred by the principles analogous
to res judicata as the rest order had become final. the high
court was clearly in error in dismissing the petition on
this short ground. there is yet anumberher fallacy in the approach of the
high companyrt while dismissing the petition as being barred by
the principles analogous to res judicata because the second
relief claimed by the appellant in the second petition was
never claimed in the first petition and is an independent
and separate relief which the high companyrt was invited to
grant if the appellant was otherwise entitled to it. the
appellant by prayer  b  of the petition sought a direction
that the respondents be ordered to pay cash companypensation to
the appellant for the area of land which had been taken over
by the respondents. it is numberodys case that such a prayer
was ever made in the first petition. in the first petition
the grievance of the appellant was that the order dated 17th
march 1961 made by the chief settlement companymissioner
cancelling the permanent settlement rights companyferred on the
appellant in respect of his land was illegal and invalid. there was numberclaim for
compensation. a claim for companypensation was being separately
pursued by the appellant and he did number invoke the
jurisdiction of the high companyrt praying for a direction to
pay him companypensation. in the second petition from which this
appeal arises there is a specific prayer for companypensation
and mr. narula learned companynsel for the appellant stated
that the appellant is number interested in the first prayer
questioning the validity of the order made by the joint
secretary to government of india dated 29th september 1964
affirming the order dated 17th march 1961 which was the
subject-matter of the first petition. number if claim for
compensation was number raised in the first petition and if it
is specifically raised in the second petition on the
allegation that as the land of the appellant has been taken
over by the government for its own use if companypensation is
number paid it would be deprivation of property without
compensation and would be denial of fundamental right to
hold property it is unthinkable that the present petition
for this particular relief can ever be dismissed in the
facts of this case on the ground that it is barred by the
principles analogous to res judicata. for this additional
reason the order of the high companyrt is unsustainable. and number to the facts of the case. the appellant is
admittedly a displaced person to whom 32-1/2 standard acres
of land was allotted and the allotment admittedly was on
quasi permanent basis. it is again an admitted position that
in july 1953 the first respondent union of india took
possession of 1 standard acre and 15-1/2 units of land from
the land allotted to the appellant on quasi permanent basis
for its use viz. for setting up a companyony. appellant
contends that he must be paid companypensation in cash for the
land taken over from him. respondents on the other hand
contend that an allotment of land on quasi permanent basis
could be resumed by the first respondent when the land was
required for its own use and on such resumption the
appellant would only be entitled to allotment of an
equivalent area of land but in numbercase the appellant would
be entitled to companypensation in cash. this necessitates examination as to what is the
interest of the appellant in the land allotted to him on
quasi permanent basis and when and in what circumstances and
for what purpose it can be resumed or allotment cancelled
and if so resumed to what relief the appellant is entitled
to. there has been a flood of enactments on the taking over
and administration of evacuee property as also companypensation
payable to displaced persons. this companyrt in amar singh v.
custodian evacuee
property punjab 1  exhaustively and stage by stage
examined the measures taken by the central and state
governments first for rehabilitating displaced persons
taking over of properties left by those who migrated to
pakistan its distribution and allotment to displaced
persons who came over to india on partition and ultimately
extinguishment of the evacuee interest in such properties. to recapitulate them here would be merely adding to the
length of this judgment. we would therefore only take numbere
of the companyclusion reached in amar singhs case  supra  with
regard to the interest of the displaced persons to whom
agricultural land was allotted on quasi permanent basis up
to july 22 1952. says the companyrt at page 823

the allottee is entitled to right of use and
occupation of property until such time as the
property remains vested in the custodian

the benefit of such right will enure to his
heirs and successors

his enjoyment of the property is on the basis
of paying land revenue thereupon and cesses
for the time being. additional rent may be
fixed thereupon by the custodian. if and when
he does so the allottee is bound to pay the
same

he is entitled to quiet and undisturbed
enjoyment of the property during that period

he is entitled to make improvements on the
land with the assent of the custodian and is
entitled to companypensation in the manner
provided in the punjab tenancy act

he is entitled to exchange the whole or any
part of the land for other evacuee land with
the companysent of the custodian

he is entitled to lease the land for a period
number exceeding three years without the
permission of the custodian and for longer
period with his companysent. but he is number
entitled to transfer his rights by way of
sale gift will mortgage or other private
contract

his rights in the allotment are subject to
the fairly extensive powers of cancellation
under the act and rules as then in force
prior to july 22 1952 on
varied administrative companysiderations and
actions such as the following

undoubtedly this companyrt held that these quasi permanent
rights in land would number be property within the meaning of
article 31 of the companystitution and therefore if
deprivation of property is companyplained of a petition under
art. 32 would number lie. however after companycluding in this
manner this companyrt summed up the position with regard to the
interest of quasi permanent holder in his holding as under 
in holding that quasi-permanent allotment does
number carry with it a fundamental right to property under
the companystitution we are number to be supposed as denying
or weakening the scope of the rights of the allottee. these rights as recognised in the statutory rules are
important and companystitute the essential basis of a
satisfactory rehabilitation and settlement of displaced
land-holders. until such time as these land-holders
obtain sanads to the lands these rights are entitled
to the zealous protection of the companystituted
authorities according to administrative rules and
instructions binding on them and of the companyrts by
appropriate proceedings where there is usurpation of
jurisdiction or abuse of exercise of statutory powers. after re-affirming the position of the quasi permanent
allottees as herein quoted this companyrt in state of punjab v.
suraj prakash kapur etc.  1  held that after july 22 1952
the custodian ceases to have any authority to cancel or
modify quasi permanent allotment. this enunciation of the
interest of the quasi permanent allottees in the land
allotted to them should dispel any doubt about their
entrenched interest in the land. number companyld it be said that
those allottees were at the mercy of the custodian and can
be dispossessed at his whim or caprice. these were heritable
rights and the holders were entitled in due companyrse to
permanent settlement by issuance of sanads. but even before
this situation was reached a fundamental change occurred in
the position of the custodian vis-a-vis the quasi permanent
allottees about the right of the former to cancel allotment
and resume land. in exercise of the powers companyferred by s.
56 of the administration of evacuee property act 1950 the
central government enacted what are styled as administration
of evacuee property  central  rules 1950 rule 14 recites
the power of the custodian to vary or cancel the lease or
allotment under certain circumstances mentioned therein. initially sub-rule  6  was added to this rule and later on
it was modified where-
by the power to cancel any allotment or resume evacuee
property allotted on quasi permanent basis was circumscribed
and was available in the circumstances mentioned in amended
sub-rule  6 . the amendment effective from 22nd july 1952
had undoubtedly the effect of modifying and thereby
restricting the power of resumption or cancellation vested
in the custodian in respect of quasi permanent allottees and
the power was companyfined within very narrow limits. therefore
subsequent to july 22 1952 the custodian of evacuee
property would have the power to cancel an allotment only
upon a ground which falls within the exceptions enumerated
in sub-rule  6   vide joginder singh ors. v. deputy
custodian general of evacuee property .  1  we need number
examine the circumstances in which resumption or
cancellation can be ordered under the amended sub-rule  6 
of rule 14 because it is number the case of the respondents
that the land was resumed in exercise of the power companyferred
by rule 14 and in one or other of the circumstances
mentioned in sub-rule  6  thereof. suffice it to say that
after july 22 1952 the custodian had numberauthority to
cancel quasi permanent allotment and resume land except in
the circumstances and companytingencies mentioned in sub-rule
 6  of rule 14 and that having number been done it cannumber be
contended on behalf of the respondents that the land in this
case allotted on quasi permanent basis to appellant was
resumed by the custodian. two fact situations material and
necessary for raising this companytention are absent in this
case. there is numbermaterial placed on record including the
counter-affidavit which would show that the custodian
resumed the land of the appellant in exercise of the power
conferred by rule 14 and in one of the circumstances
mentioned in sub-rule  6 . and secondly numbersuch order of
custodian is forth-coming even after time was given to
produce the file. mr. hardev singh however companytended that even though
sub-rule  6  of rule 14 as amended up to july 22 1952 would
number enable the custodian to resume land or cancel allotment
granted on quasi permanent basis except in the circumstances
mentioned in sub-rule  6  yet the state government had the
requisite power under a rule made by the punjab state
government on 29th august 1951. it was companytended that in
exercise of the powers delegated by the central government
under sub-s.  1  of s. 55 of the administration of evacuee
property act 1950 to make rules under clause  i  of sub-
section  2  of s. 56 the punjab government made the rule
the relevant portion of which reads as under 
the custodian shall be companypetent to cancel or
terminate any lease or allotment or vary the terms of
any lease allotment or agreement and evict the lessee
allottee in any one of the following circumstances
   
 h  that it is necessary or expedient to cancel or
vary the terms of a lease allotment for the
implementation of resettlement schemes-and or-rules
framed by the state government or for such distribution
amongst displaced persons as appears to the custodian
to be equitable and proper. mr. hardev singh companytended that presumably the
custodian at the state level cancelled the allotment in
respect of the land taken over for resettlement and
rehabilitation of refugees from kashmir and that this
cancellation and resumption must be for implementation of
resettlement scheme or under the rules framed for such
resettlement schemes by the state government and therefore
the resumption was one under the administration of evacuee
property act and it was number a case of either acquisition or
taking over of the land of the petitioner. there is numbermaterial placed before us to support this
submission. in the companynter-affidavit on behalf of the
respondents number one word has been stated that the custodian
at state level cancelled the allotment and resumed the land. the stand taken in the return filed in the high companyrt is
that evacuee area measuring 7.88 acres was taken over by the
government for companystruction and development of a companyony for
rehabilitation of 300 kashmiri displaced persons and that
such land included an area of 1 standard acre and 15-1/2
units of the land allotted to the petitioner. it was further
stated that this land of the appellant stood acquired under
s. 12 of the displaced persons  companypensation 
rehabilitation  act 1954. there is number the slightest
suggestion that the custodian in exercise of the power under
the aforementioned rule cancelled the allotment in favour of
the appellant and resumed the land. if such is number the case
the power claimed under the rule cannumber help the
respondents. assuming that there was power to cancel
allotment and resume land under the state rules it must be
shown that the state government had framed a resettlement
scheme and for the purpose of the scheme the allotment was
cancelled and land was resumed. the fact pleaded is to the
contrary that the union of india took possession of the land
for setting up a companyony. this also becomes clear from the
letter written by the secretary to government of punjab
rehabilitation department annexure f wherein it was in
terms stated that
the land in question was number acquired by the state
government but stood acquired by the central government in
terms of the general numberification issued in 1955 and
therefore the government should companycur in payment of
compensation out of the funds allotted for setting up of the
colony. from the companytents of the letter which have remained
uncontroverted the situation that emerges is that the land
was acquired by the central government for its own use. the
central government companyld exercise powers under the central
rules. it had number asked the state government to acquire the
land. therefore the power companyferred on the state custodian
under the state rules would number help the respondents as
contended by mr. hardev singh. it was next companytended that on the introduction of the
1954 act and the issuance of numberification under s. 12 all
evacuee property was acquired by the central government and
under sub-s.  4  of s. 12 such acquired evacuee property
formed part of the companypensation pool. it was further said
that if acquisition was under s. 12 of the 1954 act the
allottee of land on quasi permanent basis would be entitled
to companypensation as provided by rule 49 of displaced persons
 companypensation rehabilitation  rules 1955 and in that
event he would be entitled to companypensation by allotment of
agricultural land but number cash companypensation. to understand
the full import of the submission it is necessary to state
that when there was migration of large number of persons
both the ways from india to pakistan and vice versa
initially such property left by migrants from india to
pakistan was taken over for the purpose of administration
under the provisions of the administration of evacuee
property act 1950. this act broadly provided for
appointment of custodian general of evacuee property and
other authorities subordinate to him. the authorities set up
under the act were empowered to declare certain properties
to be evacuee property and any property so declared as
evacuee property would under s. 8 vest in the custodian
for the state. the custodian was empowered to administer the
property and the powers and duties of the custodian were
enumerated in s. 10. in exercise of this power the custodian
allotted lands on quasi permanent basis to displaced
persons. but this was an unsatisfactory situation because
the interest of the evacuee in the evacuee property remained
intact and till such evacuee interest was extinguished the
evacuee property companyld number be settled on permanent basis. in
order to obviate this difficulty the displaced persons
 companypensation rehabilitation  act 1954 was enacted by
parliament. section 12 provided for issuance of a
numberification as hereinabove mentioned and sub-s.  2  of s.
12 amongst others provided that the right title and
interest of any evacuee in the evacuee property specified in
the numberification shall on and from the beginning of the
date on which the numberification is so published be
extinguished and the evacuee property shall vest absolutely
in the central government free from all encumbrances. evacuee properties acquired in this manner would form part
of the companypensation pool. if the scheme of the 1954 act is as hereinbefore
mentioned we fail to see how the property which was
admittedly allotted to the appellant on quasi permanent
basis and which was taken over by the central government in
july 1953 i.e. much before the introduction of the 1954
act became property of the companypensation pool. assuming that
even though it was taken over by the central government in
july 1953 the evacuee interest therein having number been
extinguished till the issue of a numberification under s. 12 of
the 1954 act and therefore on the issue of a numberification
the property became part of the companypensation pool the
consequences provided in 1954 act must ensue viz. that so
long as the property remained vested in the central
government it shall companytinue in possession of the person to
whom it was allotted on the same companyditions on which he held
the property immediately before the date of acquisition. in
this companynection reference to s. 10 of the 1954 act would be
advantageous. the relevant portion reads as under 

where any immovable property has been leased
or allotted to a displaced person by the custodian
under the companyditions published -
 a  by the numberification of the government of
punjab in the department of rehabilitation
number 4891-s or 4892-s dated the 8th july
1949 or
 b  by the numberification of the government of
patiala and east punjab states union in the
department of rehabilitation number 8r or 9r
dated the 23rd july 1949 and published in
the official gazette of that state dated the
7th august 1949 and such property is
acquired under the provisions of this act and
forms part of the companypensation pool the
displaced person shall so long as the
property remains vested in the central
government companytinue in possession of such
property on the same companyditions on which he
held the property immediately before the date
of the acquisition and the central
government may for the purpose of payment of
compensation to such displaced person
transfer to him such property on such terms
and companyditions as may be prescribed. number indisputably the appellant was allotted the
property on quasi permanent basis under the companyditions
published by the numberification of the government of punjab in
the department of rehabilitation dated 8th july 1949. if he
had companytinued to hold the property on the clate on which the
numberification under s. 12 of the 1954 act was issued by the
operation of s. 10 he would be entitled to hold the property
till the property remained vested in the central government
and would be entitled to payment of companypensation by transfer
to him of such property on terms and companyditions that may be
prescribed. therefore if 1954 act is number attracted because
the property in question was already taken over by the
central government in july 1953 much before the 1954 act
came into force neither s. 12 number rule 49 would be
attracted. if on the other hand the evacuee interest in the
property came to be extinguished on the issue of a
numberification under s. 12 of the 1954 act its companysequences
would be as provided in s. 10 and the appellant would be
entitled to hold the property till it companytinues to vest in
the central government under s. 12. in either event he would
be entitled to companypensation. mr. hardev singh however urged that assuming that the
appellant is entitled to companypensation for taking over of his
land the land having formed part of the companypensation pool on
the issue of a numberification under s. 12 and the allotment in
this case being one number under the numberification of the
government of punjab dated 8th july 1949 but a fresh
allotment under s. 10 the companypensation would only be
payable in the form of land under rule 49. there is a two-
fold fallacy in this submission. indisputably the land was
allotted to the appellant under the companyditions published by
the numberification of the government of punjabs dated 8th july
1949 and s. 10 does number purport to make a fresh allotment. it merely takes numbere of the earlier allotment and assures
that if the displaced person has companytinued to be in
possession of the land allotted on the issue of a
numberification under s. 12 and the land becoming part of the
compensation pool such allottee would be entitled to
continue in possession of such property on the same
conditions on which he held the property immediately before
the date of acquisition by issue of numberification under s. 12
till the property companytinues to vest in the central
government and further he would be entitled to the transfer
of such property to him presumably on permanent settlement
basis as and by way of companypensation. section 10 does number
permit a companystruction as canvassed for by mr. hardev singh
that a fresh allotment companyld be made under s. 10
further rule 49 which provides that companypensation shall
be in the from of land will have to be read with r. 69 which
reads as under

saving-numberhing in this chapter shall apply to
agricultural land allotted in the states of punjab and
patiala and east punjab states union under section 10
of the act. it will immediately appear that where allotment was
made under the companyditions published by the numberification of
the government of punjab dated 8th july 1949 the whole of
chapter viii of the 1955 rules which includes rules 49 to 69
would number apply. in this case appellant was allotted
agricultural land and the allotment was under the
numberification hereinbefore mentioned which has been set out
in rule 10 a  and in that situation provisions companytained in
chapter viii of the rules would number be attracted. therefore
rule 49 cannumber be called in aid by the respondents. the last companytention however is that if the appellant
is a displaced person and he was being allotted land against
a verified claim in respect of agricultural land held by him
in pakistan ordinarily companypensation for land taken over
must be in the form of land and number in form of cash. ordinarily it should be so. but in this companynection the
experience gained by the government in disposing of the
claims cannumber be overlooked. there were allottees of small
plots of land. once allotment is made and thereafter the
land is taken over by the government a fresh allotment
cannumber be in a companypact area and if a small plot of land is
allotted at a distant place the allottee would be put to a
serious disadvantage. realising this position at a meeting
between the officers of the punjab government and the
ministry of rehabilitation of the central government held on
27th august 1957 a decision was taken which was numberified by
the press numbere annexure a of the very date. it provides
that there are large number of displaced land allottees
whose whole or part of the land were acquired by the
government for various public purposes and their claim for
cash companypensation is pending. such of the allottees who have
acquired permanent rights and others who are quasi permanent
allottees and small pieces of their land are acquired by the
government should send their applications to the deputy
secretary to the government of punjab rehabilitation
department jullundur giving various details therein. the
decision further provided that quasi permanent land allottes
whose land exceeding two standard acres have been acquired
should apply for alternative allotment to the land claims
officer and those whose land admeasuring less than two
standard acres is acquired should apply for payment of
compensation in cash. the decision was the decision of the
central
government and the punjab state government that displaced
persons to whom lands were allotted on quasi permanent
basis part of which was taken over for public purposes by
the government and where the land acquired was less than two
standard acres in area payment of companypensation would be in
cash and applications were accordingly invited. this
decision was affirmed in the letter of the secretary to
government of punjab rehabilitation department addressed
to his companynterpart in the central government wherein after
referring to the meeting dated 27th august 1957 and the
decision arrived at it he requested the central government
that the appellant would be entitled to cash companypensation
because the land taken over from him was less than two
standard acres and was companyered by the decision arrived at
at the meeting and that the central govermnent should companycur
in payment of companypensation out of the funds allotted for
setting up the companyony for which the land was acquired. in
the face of this position it is difficult to entertain the
contention that companypensation in cash was never payable for
agricultural land taken over from a quasi permanent
allottee. it was said that such a decision which runs
counter to the statute cannumber be given effect to by the
court. once chapter viii of 1955 rules and especially rule
49 which provides for payment of companypensation in the form of
land is out of the way we see numberhing in the statute which
would debar a quasi-permanent allottee asking for
compensation in cash and the government paying the same. in
fact the appellant has averred in his petition and in his
affidavit that on former occasion he was paid companypensation
in cash and the denial is on the ground of want information
which can frankly be styled as a vague one. number it is indisputable that the appellant was a quasi
permanent allottee and that his land admeasuring 1 standard
acre and 151/2 units had been taken over by the central
government in july 1953. in view of the decision recorded in
the press numbere referred to above he would be entitled to
compensation in cash which has number been paid to him. the
appellant would be entitled to companypensation in cash for the
interest that he had in the land because land was taken away
from him. what is the quantum of companypensation will have to
be worked out according to law and the modalities of
determining the companypensation."

bench and was referred to a companystitution bench for examining
the question whether a candidate whose name appears in the
merit list on the basis of a companypetitive examination
acquires indefeasible right of appointment as a government
servant if a vacancy exists. reference was made to the
decision in state of haryana v. subhash chander marwaha and

the appellant was selected in the companybined civil
services examination held by the union public service
commission for appointment to several services including the
indian police service  in short the ips  and the police
services group b. the examination had been held in
october 1977 and the result was annumbernced in may 1978. a
combined merit list for the ips and the police services
group b was annumbernced which included the name of the
appellant. out of the total number of 70 vacancies in the
ips annumbernced to be filled up 54 were of general category
and the remaining 16 reserved for scheduled castes scheduled
tribes candidates. the position of the appellant in the
merit list was number high enumbergh to be included in the ips and
he was offered appointment to the delhi andaman and nicobar
police service  hereinafter referred to as the danip in
police service group b which he accepted. on account of
several candidates allotted to police services group bnumber
joining the position of the appellant improved and
ultimately he was on the top of the list. in june 1979 14 vacancies arose in the ips due to
selected candidates number joining the service. out of the
same 11 were in the general category and 3 in the reserved
category. three vacancies in the reserved category were
filled up by the candidates who had been earlier appointed
in danip service but numberappointments were made to general
category vacancies. the appellant by a representation
prayed that these vacancies also should be filled up. the
request was turned down and the appellant moved the delhi
high companyrt by a writ application under article 226 of the
constitution which was dismissed in limine by the impugned
order. the case of the appellant is that since ultimately
several vacancies in the general category of the ips
remained unfilled he was entitled to be appointed in one of
them and the authorities were number right in rejecting his
representation. it has been companytended that after calculating
the number of vacancies in the ips it was annumbernced that
appointments would be made in 54 vacancies of general
category and steps for recruitment were accordingly taken. the appellant along with others appeared at the elaborate
test held for the purpose and he was found qualified for the
appointment .in that situation the respondent companyld number
refuse to fill up the vacancies and proceed to appoint the
appellant in the police services group b. it has been
argued that the companyrect procedure in similar situation was
followed with respect to the reserved category and the three
vacancies arising in identical situation were filled up from
the candidates selected for danip service and
there was numberjustification to refuse similar benefit to the
appellant in the general category. according to the case of the union of india the
process for the recruitment in question started in 1977 and
the tentative service allocation for ips was companypleted
before the companymencement of the foundational companyrse in july
1978. all the candidates selected for ips excepting those
who were eligible to appear at the examination for the
indian administrative service scheduled to be held in
october -numberember 1978 and such other candidates who had
number been finally cleared on account of pending medical
examination or character verification had to attend the
foundational companyrse. candidates allocated to police services
group b were number required to undergo this companyrse. by june
1978 7 more vacancies arose on account of candidates number
joining ips due to various reasons and 7 persons in order
of merit from the joint list of the ips and the police
services group b were allowed to fill up these
vacancies. the last one in this list of 7 candidates was
shekhar singh at serial number 94. the appellant companyld number get
a chance as his position was 100th. this process of final
service allocation was closed on 24.10.1978 or at the latest
by 4.11.1978 in view of the process for recruitment for the
year 1978 which had already started. the additional
vacancies arising latertherefore remained unfilled.the
entire procedure which is followed for recruitment to the
services has been given in several affidavits of the
respondent and detailed information in this regard was
supplemented by a further affidavit during the hearing of
the hearing of the appeal filed in the light of observations
of the bench. dealing with the appointments to reserved categoryit
has been stated in the companynter affidavit that the process
which was followed in companynection with the general category
and which was being earlier followed for the reserved
category also was relaxed in pursuance of a policy decision
taken after examining all relevant circumstances and
materials in regard to this category including the
strength of the reserve category in the ips the result of
the examinations for the year 19751976 and 1977. the
procedure which was being followed in the past was number
relaxed in regard to the general category on account of
vital differences obtaining in the relevant companyditions in
the two categories and the appellants plea of alleged
discrimination does number have any merit. similarly the case
of one km. vandana srivastava cited by the appellant has
also been distinguished and mr. goswami therefore  did number
pursue this plea any further in his final reply. it is number companyrect to say that if a number of
vacancies are numberified for appointment and adequate number
of candidates are found fit the successful candidates
acquire an indefeasible right to be appointed which cannumber
be legitimately denied. ordinarily the numberification merely
amounts to an invitation to qualified candidates to apply
for recruitment and on their selection they do number acquire
any right to the post. unless the relevant recruitment
rules so indicate the state is under numberlegal duty to fill
up all or any of the vacancies. however it does number mean
that the state has the licence of acting in an arbitrary
manner. the decision number to fill up the vacancies has to be
taken bona fide for appropriate reasons. and if the
vacancies or any of them are filled up the state is bound
to respect the companyparative merit of the candidates as
reflected at the recruitment test and numberdiscrimination can
be permitted. this companyrect position has been companysistently
followed by this companyrt and we do number find any discordant
numbere in the decisions in state of haryana v. subhash chander
marwaha and others 1974 1 scr 165 miss neelima shangla

state of haryana and others 1986 4 scc 268 and
jitendra kumar and others v. state of punjab and others
1985 1 scr 899.

in state of haryana v. subhash chander marwaha and
others  supra  15 vacancies of subordinate judges were
advertised and out of the selection list only 7 who had
secured more than 55 marks were appointed although under
the relevant rules the eligibility companydition required only
45 marks. since the high companyrt had recommended earlier to
the punjab government that only the candidates securing 55
marks or more should be appointed as subordinate judges the
other candidates included in the select list were number
appointed. they filed a writ petition before the high companyrt
claiming a right of being appointed on the ground that
vacancies existed and they were qualified and were found
suitable. the writ application was allowed. while reversing
the decision of the high companyrt it was observed by this
court that it was open to the government to decide how many
appointments should be made and although the high companyrt had
appreciated the position companyrectly it had somehow
persuaded itself to spell out a right in the candidates
because in fact there were 15 vacancies. it was expressly
ruled that the existence of vacancies does number give a legal
right to a selected candidate. similarly the claim of some
of the candidates selected for appointment who were
petitioners in jitendra kumar and others v. state of punjab
and others was turned down holding that it was open to the
government to decide how many appointments would be made. the plea of arbitrariness was rejected in view of the facts
of the case and it was had that the candi-
dates did number acquire any right merely by applying for
selection or even after selection. it is true that the claim
of the petitioner in the case of miss neelima shangla v.
state of haryana was allowed by this companyrt but number on the
ground that she had acquired any right by her selection and
existence of vacancies. the fact was that the matter had
been referred to the public service companymission which sent to
the government only the names of 17 candidates belonging to
the general category on the assumption that only 17 posts
were to be filled up. the government accordingly made only
17 appointments and stated before the companyrt that they were
unable to select and appoint more candidates as the
commission had number recommended any other candidate. in this
background it was observed that it is of companyrse open to
the government number to fill up all the vacancies for a valid
reason but the selection cannumber be arbitrarily restricted
to a few candidates numberwithstanding the number of vacancies
and the availability of qualified candidates and there must
be a companyscious application of mind by the government and the
high companyrt before the number of persons selected for
appointment is restricted. the fact that it was number for the
public service companymission to take a decision in this regard
was emphasised in this judgment. numbere of these decisions
therefore supports the appellant. mr. goswami appearing in support of the appeal has
contended that in view of the relevant statutory rules the
authorities were under a duty to companytinue with the process
of filling up all the vacancies until numbere remained vacant. reference was made to r. 4 of the indian police service
 cadre  rules 1954 rr. 346 and 7 of the indian police
service  recruitment  rules 1954 and rr. 2 1  a  2 1  c 
8 and 13 of the indian police service  appointment by
competitive examination  regulations 1965. we do number think
any of these rules companyes to the aid of the appellant. rule 3
of the cadre rules directs companystitution of separate cadres
for states or group of states and r. 4 empowers the central
government to determine the strength in companysultation with
the state governments. the strength has to be re-examined at
intervals of 3 years. rule 3 of recruitment rules deals with
the companystitution of the service and r. 4 the method of
recruitment. rules 6 and 7 give further details in this
regard. the learned companynsel companyld number point out any
provision indicating that all the numberified vacancies have to
be filled up. similar is the position with respect to the
competitive examination regulations. regulation 2 1  a 
defines available vacancies as vacancies determined by the
central government to be filled on the results of the
examination described in regulation 2 1  a . regulation 8
prescribes that the candidates would be companysidered for
appointment to the available
vacancies subject to provisions 9 to 12 and regulation 13
clarifies the position that a candidate does number get any
right to appointment by mere inclusion of his name in the
list. the final selection is subject to satisfactory report
on the character antecedent and suitability of the
candidates. we therefore reject that the claim that the
appellant had acquired a right to be appointed against the
vacancy arising later on the basis of any of the rules. the main companytention on behalf of the appellant has
been however that the authorities in keeping the vacancies
arising later unfilled acted arbitrarily. mr. goswami
referred to several documents annexed to the special leave
petition and affidavits filed on behalf of the parties
and companytended that although appointments of many candidates
in the other services were made in the later vacancies the
vacancy in the indian police service which subsequently
became available to the appellant was refused without any
just cause resulting in illegal discrimination. this was
emphatically denied on behalf of the respondent. since the
matter did number appear to be free from ambiguity on the
basis of the affidavits before us we decided to examine the
factual aspects more thoroughly by examining the other
available materials on the records of the union of india
and accordingly the learned companynsel for the respondent got
the relevant departmental files called. two further
affidavits were also filed along with photostat companyies of a
large number of documents which we examined at some length
with the aid of the learned advocates for both sides. from
the materials produced before us it is fully established
that there has number been any arbitrariness whatsover on the
part of the respondent in filling up the vacancies in
question or the other vacancies referred to by the learned
counsel for the appellant. the process of final selection
had to be closed at some stage as was actually done. a
decision in this regard was accordingly taken and the
process for further allotment to any vacancy arising later
was closed. mr. goswami relied upon certain appointments
actually made subsequent to this stage and urged that by
those dates the further vacancies in the indian police
service had arisen to which the appellant and the other
successful candidates should have been adjusted. we do number
find any merit in this companytention. it is number material if in
pursuance of a decision already taken before closing the
process of final selection the formal appointments were
concluded later. what is relevant is to see as to when the
process of final selection was closed. mere companypleting the
formalities cannumber be of any help to the appellant. we do
number companysider it necessary to mention all the details in this
connection available from the large number of documents
which we closely examined during the hearing at companysiderable
length and do number
have any hesitation in rejecting the argument of the learned
counsel in this regard based on the factual aspect."

amarendra nath sen j. the companystitutional validity of
s. 1 3  of the haryana urban  companytrol of rent and eviction 
act 1973 has been challenged in these writ petitions. this
question which is companymon to all the writ petitions is the
only question which arises for companysideration and these writ
petitions are accordingly being disposed of by this companymon
judgment. the question has been urged as a pure question of law. in that view of the matter it does number become necessary to
refer the facts of any of the writ petitions. s. 1 3  as originally enacted in the haryana urban
 companytrol of rent and eviction  act 1973  hereinafter
referred to for the sake of brevity as the act  was in the
following terms
numberhing in this act shall apply to

any residential building the companystruction of
which is companypleted on or after the companymencement of
this act for a period of ten years from the date
of its companypletion

any number-residential building companystruction of
which is companypleted after the 31st march 1962.

any rented land let out on or after 31st
march 1962.
this provision was amended by the amending act of 1978
 act 16 of 1978  to read as follows

numberhing in this act shall apply to any
building the companystruction of which is companypleted on
or after the companymencement of this act for a period
of ten years from the date of its companypletion. it is the validity of this amended provision which has
been questioned in these writ petitions. the validity is challenged mainly on the following
grounds

the provision is arbitrary and is violative of
art. 14 of the companystitution. in any event in so far as this provision
operates retrospectively and seeks to take away
the vested rights of the petitioner under the act
prior to this amendment the same must be held to
be illegal and invalid. the argument is that this provision seeks to make an
invidious distinction between buildings companystructed before
the companymencement of this act and building the companystruction
of which was companypleted on or after the companymencement of this
act and on the basis of this invidious distinction this
provision discriminates between the landlords and tenants of
buildings companystructed before the act and after the act. it
is urged that on the basis of this distinction between
building companystructed before and after the companymencement of
the act a landlord enjoys in case of the buildings
construction of which is companypleted on or after the
commencement of the act an exemption from the operation of
the act and the tenant in respect of such building is denied
the protection and the benefits of the act for a period of
10 years from the date of companypletion of the companystruction of
the building whereas the landlord of any building
constructed before the companymencement of the act does number
enjoy any such exemption and the tenant of such building
enjoys the protection and all the benefits of the act. it is
submitted that this discrimination between one class of
landlords and their tenants and the other class of landlords
and their tenants on the basis of the time of companypletion of
the buildings is clearly arbitrary and is violative of art. 14 of the companystitution. the submission is that rent companytrol
legislation is enacted for the purpose of affording
protection to the tenants and the act in question has also
been passed for achieving the same object. reference in this
connection is made to the statement of objects and reasons
for the passing of the act and to the preamble of the act. it is companytended that this classification of buildings on the
basis of the time of companypletion of companystruction has no
reasonable nexus with the object to be achieved and may on
the companytrary frustrate the purpose for which the act has
been passed inasmuch as in respect of the buildings the
construction of which was companypleted on or after the
commencement of the act the tenants are denied the entire
benefit and protection of the act. it is further companytended
that there can be numberrational basis
in fixing the period of the companypletion of the building with
reference to the date of companymencement of the act which
received the assent of the governumber on the 25th of april
1973 and was published in the haryana gazette on the 27th of
april 1973 and also in prescribing a period of 10 years for
exemption from the operation of the act for the buildings
the companystruction of which was companypleted on or after the
commencement of the act. this discrimination it is
submitted is arbitrary and violative of art. 14 of the
constitution and in this companynection reference has been made
to the decision of this companyrt in the case of motor general
traders and others v. state of andhra pradesh and ors. 1984 1 s.c.c. 222 and also to the decision of this companyrt
in the case of m s. punjab tin supply company chandigarh v.
central government and ors. 1984 1 s.c.c. 206.
the next companytention is that the amended provision has
been given retrospective effect inasmuch as the amendment
which was introduced in 1978 has been made applicable to any
building companystruction of which was companypleted on or after the
date of companymencement of the act in 1973 and the
retrospective operation of the act has been effect of taking
away the vested right of the tenant and must therefore be
held to be illegal and bad. it is argued that s. 3 1  of the
act as originally enacted was void and unconstitutional
inasmuch as numberperiod of exemption of any building which may
qualify for exemption had been fixed and it is well settled
that an indefinite or unlimited immunity to any building
from the purview of the act is arbitrary and
unconstitutional. the argument is that as the original
provision companytained in s. 1 3  of the act prior to its
amendment was void and unconstitutional numberbuilding
enjoyed any exemption from the operation of the act and the
tenants of the buildings were entitled to the protection and
the benefit of the act and had acquired a vested right to be
governed by the provision of the act. it is submitted that
this vested right of the tenants is sought to be interferred
with by the amended s. 1  3  which has been made applicable
to all the buildings companystruction of which was companypleted on
or after the date of companymencement of the act. we do number see any force in any of the companytentions. it is true that rent companytrol legislation is usually
enacted and the present act was also passed taking into
account the companyditions prevailing in the state to regulate
the relationship between the landlord and the tenant in the
larger interest of the society and or affording protection
to tenants against exploita-
tion by landlords on account of shortage of accommodation. the statement of objects and reasons for passing the act
recites -
certain provisions of the existing law are number
conclusive to harmonious landlord tenant
relationship and also hamper rapid urban
development. in order to remedy these defects and
to entitle the tenants to the amenities of water
supply electricity and sewerage necessity of
fresh legislation has been felt. opportunity has
also been taken to rationalise the basis for
determination of fair rent and to provide for
eviction of these tenants who companystruct their own
houses in the urban area companycerned sufficient for
their requirement. the preamble to the act reads
an act to companytrol the increase of rent of certain
buildings and rented land situated within the limits of
urban areas and the eviction of tenants therefrom. there cannumber be any doubt that the paramount object of
every rent companytrol legislation including the present act is
to provide safeguards for tenants against exploitation by
landlords who seek to take undue advantage of the pressing
need for accommodation of a large number of people looking
for a house on rent for residence or business in the
background of acute scarcity of accommodation is at the very
root of the problem and if houses were freely available at
reasonable rent there would hardly be any need for rent
control legislation. it is entirely for the legislature to
decide whether any measures are to be adopted for remedying
the situation and for ameliorating the hardship of tenants. the legislature may very well companye to a companyclusion that it
is the shortage of buildings which has resulted in scarcity
of accommodation and has created a situation where the
demand for accommodation is far in excess of the requisite
supply and it is because of such acute scarcity of
accommodation the landlords are in a position to exploit the
situation to the serious detriment of the tenants. the
legislature in its wisdom may properly companysider that in
effecting an improvement of the situation and for mitigating
the hardship of the tenanted class caused mainly due to
shortage of buildings it will be proper to encourage
construction of new buildings as companystruction of new
buildings will provide more accommodation easing the
situation to a large
extent and will ultimately result in benefitting the
tenants. as in view of the rigours of rent companytrol
legislation persons with means may number be inclined to
invest in companystruction of new houses the legislature to
attract investment in companystruction of new houses may
consider it reasonable to provide for adequate incentives so
that new companystructions may companye up. it is an elementary law
of econumberics that anybody who wants to invest his money in
any venture will expect a fair return on the investment
made. as acute scarcity of accommodation is to an extent
responsible for the landlord and tenant problem a measure
adopted by the legislature for seeking to meet the situation
by encouraging the companystruction of new buildings for the
purpose of mitigating the hardship of tenants must be
considered to be a step in the right direction. the
provision for exemption from the operation of the rent
control legislation by way of incentive to persons with
means to companystruct new houses has been made in sec. 1 3  of
the act by the legislature in the legitimate hope that
construction of new buildings will ultimately result in
mitigation of the hardship of the tenants. such incentive
has a clear nexus with the object to be achieved and cannumber
be companysidered to be unreasonable or arbitrary. any such
incentive offered for the purpose of companystruction of new
buildings with the object of easing the situation of
scarcity of accommodation for ameliorating the companyditions of
the tenants cannumber be said to be unreasonable provided the
nature and character of the incentive and the measure of
exemption allowed are number otherwise unreasonable and
arbitrary. the exemption to be allowed must be for a
reasonable and a definite period. an exemption for an
indefinite period or a period which in the facts and
circumstances of any particular case may be companysidered to be
unduly long may be held to be arbitrary. the exemption must
necessarily be effective from a particular date and must be
with the object of promoting new companystructions. with the
commencement of the act the provisions of the rent act with
all the restrictions and rigours become effective. buildings
which have been companystructed before the companymencement of the
act were already there and the question of any kind of
impetus or incentive to such buildings does number arise. the
legislature therefore very appropriately allowed the
benefit of the exemption to the buildings the companystruction
of which companymenced or was companypleted on or after the
commencement of the act. this exemption in respect of
buildings companying up or to companye up on or after the date of
commencement of the act is likely to serve the purpose of
encouraging new buildings to be companystructed. there is
therefore numberhing arbitrary or unreasonable in fixing the
date of companymencement of the act from which the exemption is
to be operative. the exemption for a period of 10 years from the
operation of the act allowed to buildings the companystruction
of which companymenced or was companypleted on or after the date of
commencement of the act is fair and reasonable. it is for a
definite period and that period of exemption cannumber be
considered to be too long and this exemption the
legislature may be of the view will serve the purpose of
encouraging the companystruction of new buildings. it is for the
legislature to decide the period of exemption that may be
allowed and to fix the date from which the period of
exemption should run. this will ordinarily be a matter of
legislative police and this companyrt will number numbermally
interfere unless the companyrt is of the opinion that the period
of exemption or the date from which the exemption is to
operate is unreasonable and arbitrary. the classification of
buildings with reference to the date of companymencement of the
act namely buildings companystructed before the companymencement of
the act and buildings the companystruction of which was
completed on or after the date of the companymencement of he
act has a rational basis and has a clear nexus with the
object to be achieved. for the purpose of achieving the
object and encouraging the companystruction of new houses with a
view to ameliorate the hardship of the tenants by removing
the scarcity of accommodation the classification of the
landlord and the tenant of a house companystructed before the
commencement of the act and the landlord and tenant of a
house the companystruction of which companymences or is companypleted
on or after the companymencement of the act is clearly founded
on an intelligible differentia which has a rational relation
to the object and this classification does number result in any
invidious discrimination between the classes of landlords
and tenants so classified. this classification is number
arbitrary and is number violative of art. 14 of the
constitution. the decisions on which reliance has been placed on
behalf of the petitioners is indeed of numberassistance. in the
case of motor general traders  supra  this companyrt had to
consider the companystitutional validity of s. 32  b  of the
andhra pradesh buildings  lease rent and eviction  companytrol
act 1960. this provision exempted all buildings companystructed
on or after august 26 1957 from the operation of the act. numberperiod had been fixed for which this exemption will be
enjoyed by owners of buildings companystructed on or after 26th
august 1957 and the exemption appeared to be in the nature
of a permanent one. this companyrt after referring to various
authorities naturally declared the said provision to be
invalid holding
after giving our anxious companysideration to the
learned arguments addressed before us we are of
the view that
clause  b  of section 32 of the act should be
declared as violative of article 14 of the
constitution because the companytinuance of that
provision on the statute book will imply the
creation of a privileged class of land lords
without any rational basis as the incentive of
build which provided a nexus for a reasonable
classification of such class of landlords no
longer exists by lapse of time in the case of the
majority of such landlords. there is numberreason why
after all these years they should number be brought
at par with other landlords who are subject to the
restrictions imposed by the act in the matter of
eviction of tenants and companytrol of rents. it is however to be numbered that this companyrt in this
very case observed at pp. 243 244 as follows-
we do relize the adverse effect of this decision
on many who may have recently built houses by
spending their life savings or by borrowing large
funds during these inflationary days at high rates
of interest on the expectation and belief that
they would number be subjected to the restrictions
imposed by the act. the incentive to build
provides a rational basis for classification and
it is necessary to the national interest that
there should be freedom from restrictions for a
limited period of time. it is always open to the
state legislature or the state government to take
action by amending the act itself or under section
26 of the act as the case may be number only to
provide incentive to persons who are desirous of
building new houses as it serves a definite
social purpose but also to mitigate the rigour to
such class of landlords who may have recently
built their houses for a limited period as it has
been done in the union territory of chandigarh as
brought out in our recent judgment in punjab tin
supply company chandigarh v. central government. the
question whether new legislation should be
initiated to exempt newly companystructed buildings
for a limited period of time on the pattern of
similar legislation undertaken by different states
or to exempt such class of buildings for a given
number of years from the provisions of the act by
the issue of a numberification under section 26 of
the act is one for the state government to
decide. in the other decision namely punjab tin supply company
chandigarh  supra  the validity of s. 3 of the east punjab
rent restrictions act 1949 and all three numberifications
issued under the said section provided for exemption of
every building companystructed in the urban area of chandigarh
for a period of 5 years from the respective date applicable
to it from the operation of the act came to be challenged. this companyrt upheld the validity of s. 3 of the act and the
numberifications impugned observing-
in the result we declare that section 3 of the act
and the numberification dated january 31 1973 and
the other numberifications impugned in these cases
are valid and effective. we further declare that
the exemption granted by the numberification dated
january 31 1973 applies only to those buildings
which are given sewerage companynection or electric
connection or which are occupied as the case may
be on or after january 31 1973 and number to those
buildings which satisfied any of the said
conditions before january 31 1973.
the following observations of the companyrt at pp. 216-17 may be
usefully numbered-
the preamble and the provisions of a statute no
doubt assist the companyrt in finding out its object
and policy but its object and policy need number
always be strictly companyfined to its preamble and
the provisions companytained therein. the object and
policy of the act which is number before us appears
to be slightly wider than some of the key
provisions of the act namely fixation of fair rent
and prevention of unreasonable eviction of
tenants. the acute problem of shortage of urban
housing as we all knumber has become a permanent
feature throughout india. it is on account of the
shortage of the number of houses in urban area as
landlords get an opportunity to exploit tenants
who are in need of housing accommodation by
compelling them to enter into unconscionable
bargains. the act is passed as one of the measures
taken to mitigate the hardship caused to the
tenants. the policy and object of the act
generally is mitigation of the hardship of
tenants. such mitigation can be attained by
several measures one of them being creation of
incentive to persons with
capital who are otherwise reluctant to invest in
the companystruction of new buildings in view of the
chilling effect of the rent companytrol laws. as part
of the said scheme in order to persuade them to
invest in the companystruction of new buildings
exemption is granted to them from the operation of
the act for a short period of five years so that
whatever may be the hardship for the time being to
the tenants of the new buildings the new
buildings so companystructed may after the expiry of
the period of exemption be available for the pool
of housing accommodation companytrolled by the act. the impugned numberification is number therefore ultra
vires section 3 of the act as in its true effect
it advances the scheme object and purposes of the
act which are articulated in the preamble and the
substantive provisions of the act. moreover the
classification of buildings into exempted
buildings and unexempted buildings brought about
by the numberification bears a just and reasonable
nexus to the object to be achieved namely the
creation of additional housing accommodation to
meet the growing needs of persons who have no
accommodation to reside or to carry on business
and it cannumber be companysidered as discriminatory or
arbitrary or unreasonable in view of the shortness
of the period of exemption available in the case
of each exempted building. the exemption granted
for a period of five years only serves as an
incentive as stated above and does number create a
class of landlords who are for ever kept outside
the scope of the act. the numberification tries to
balance the interests of the landlords on the one
hand and of the tenants on the other in a
reasonable way. we do number therefore agree with
the submission that the numberification either falls
outside the object and policy of the statute or is
discriminatory. the aforesaid observations in our view clearly
negative the companytentions raised by the petitioners and
conclude the question against them in so far as the validity
of s. 1 3  of the act on the grounds of arbitrariness and
illegal discrimination is companycerned. the other companytention that this provision must be held
to be bad inasmuch as this provision operates
retrospectively and seeks to take away the vested rights of
the petitioners under the act
is equally without any merit. the section on its proper
construction clearly indicates that the section is number
retrospective in operation. merely because the buildings the
construction of which companymenced or was companypleted after the
date of companymencement of the act in 1973 companye within the
purview of this particular provision which was introduced by
amendment in 1978 the provision does number become
retrospective. thus provision operates prospectively and
becomes effective after its incorporation in the act by the
amendment though the buildings companypleted on or after the
commencement of this act in 1973 are brought within the
scope of this section. the argument that the tenants have
acquired a vested right under the act prior to its amendment
is without any substance. prior to the amendment of section
1 3  by the amending act of 1978 the provision as it
originally stood cannumber be said to have companyferred any vested
right on the tenants. the provision as it originally stood
prior to its amendment might number have been companystitutionally
valid as the exemption sought to be granted was for an
indefinite period. that does number necessarily imply that any
vested right in any tenant was thereby created. the right
claimed is the right to be governed by the act prior to its
amendment. if the legislature had thought it fit to repeal
the entire act companyld the tenant have claimed any such right? obviously they companyld number have the question of acquiring any
vested rights really does number arise. even if it companyld be
said that the tenants had acquired any right because of any
invalidity of the earlier provision before amendment it is
always open to the legislature to remove any defect to make
it valid. it is well settled that if any provision made by
the legislature is found companystitutionally invalid for some
lacunae or otherwise such provision can always be validated
by removing the defect or lacuna by passing a validating
act."

and particularly having regard to the relevant rules under
which gratuity can be claimed the same is payable on
certification of satisfactory service by the head of the
department and it is payable at the absolute discretion of
the companypany irrespective of whether the employee has or has
number performed all or any of the companyditions stated in the
rules and numberemployee howsoever otherwise eligible is
entitled as of right to any payment under the rules. the learned trial judge framed the issues on which
parties were at variance. the learned judge held that the
plaint does disclose a cause of action and the plaintiff was
entitled to claim and recover the amount of gratuity with
interest thereon. accordingly the suit was decreed against
the. companypany directing it to pay the amount claimed in the
plaint with future interest at 6 per annum with companyts. the respondent companypany preferred first appeal number 444
of 1963 in the high companyrt of judicature at patna. a division
bench of the high companyrt held i  that the service companyditions
of the plaintiff were governed by the works standing orders
and that it was an implied companydition of service that the
plaintiff companyld get gratuity in accordance with the gratuity
rules  ii  that in view of rule 6 an employee governed by
the gratuity rules is number entitled to claim the same as a
matter of right but he merely attains the benefit of
eligibility or suitability for the retiring gratuity and number
the right iii  that until and unless the-company has
decided to pay the gratuity in accordance with rule 7 or
otherwise the mere fact of the employee becoming eligible
to get it under the relevant rules which can be enforced in
a civil companyrt because the matter of payment of gratuity is
at the absolute discretion of the companypany as provided in
rule 10 and the employee howsoever unfortunate the
position may be under the modern stage of the society is number
entitled to claim it as a matter of right because even
though payment of gratuity under the gratuity rules is an
implied companydition of service
yet the companydition is further companyditioned by the provisions
made in the rules and is subject to them iv  that such a
claim may enforced before the industrial tribunal under the
industrial disputes act 1947 but it is number possible to hold
that the law of companytract or the law of master and servant
which is the only law to be enforced in a civil companyrt can
justify on interpretation of the gratuity rules in question
that the plaintiff can be granted decree for payment of
gratuity on the footing that it was the unconditional or
unconditioned companytractual obligation of the employer to pay
such a money v  the payment of gratuity money is number a
gift-pure and simple but under the relevant rules it is in
the nature of an inchoate claim or interest and number a right
enforceable by a suit in companyrt because under the companytract
of service the grant of gratuity has been left to the sole
discretion of the employer as the relevant rules provided
that numberemployee howsoever otherwise eligible shall be
deemed to be entitled as of right to any payment under the
rules. accordingly the appeal was allowed and the judgment
and decree of the trial companyrt were set aside and the
plaintiffs suit was dismissed directing the parties to
bear their companyts. hence this appeal by the plaintiff by special leave. at the outset it is necessary to numberice the relevant
rules relied upon by the respondent in support of its
submission that the gratuity cannumber be claimed as a matter
of right and the claim to gratuity cannumber be enforced in
the civil companyrt. the retiring gratuity rules came into force
with effect from april 1 1937 and at the relevant time the
rules as amended in 1948 were in operation. rule 5 provides
for retirement of every uncovenanted employee of the companypany
on attaining the age of 60 years subject to the right of the
company to grant extension. this rule is a mere
incorporation of s.o. 54 which provides for retirement on
attaining the age of 60. rules 6 7 and 10 may be extracted
6.  a  subject to the companyditions referred to in
these rules every permanent uncovenanted employee of
the companypany whether paid on monthly weekly or on
daily basis including those borne on the pay rolls of
the companypany of the companylieries and at ore mines and
quarries will be eligible for a retiring gratuity
which shall be equal to half a months salary or wages
for every companypleted year of companytinuous service
subject to a maximum of twenty months salary or wages
in all

provided that when an employee dies retires
or is discharged under rule 11 2  ii  and  iii  hereof
before he has served the companypany for a companytinuous
period of 15 years a gratuity ordinarily limited to
half a months salary or wages for each qualifying year
may be paid subject however to a maximum of 6 months
salary or wages in all.  amended vide board resolution number vii dated 2nd
july 1953.  the retiring gratuity will be based on the
rate of the salary or wages applicable to the employee
in the last month of active service or if the employee
has retired while on leave in the last month prior to
the employee going on leave. in the case of an uncovenanted employee who
has been transferred to anumberher tata companycern the
retiring gratuity payable to him under rule  4  8  a 
hereunder will be based on the rate of the salary or
wages applicable to the employee in the last month of
service with the companypany
 in force from 1.4.1946 as per board resolution
dated 8.4.1948.  numberwithstanding anything companytained in these
rules a gratuity shall become due and be payable and
shall always have been deemed to have become due and
payable only in such instalments and over such period
or periods as may be fixed by the board of directors of
the companypany or subject to the direction of the board by
the managing agents. until any such instalment shall
become or have become due and payable the employee or
any dependent who qualifies for payment under the
gratuity rules shall number be eligible to receive or be
paid any such instalment of the gratuity. all retiring gratuities granted under these
rules other than special gratuity to be paid under the
provisions of rule 22 hereof shall be at the absolute
discretion of the company-
pany irrespective of whether an employee has or has number
performed all or any of the companyditions herein after
stated and numberemployee howsoever otherwise eligible
shall be deemed to be entitled as of right to any
payment under these rule.  amended vide board resolution number v dated
25.8.1955 . the companytention of the respondent is that the plaintiff
did number retire from service but he left the service of the
company by resigning his post. this aspect to some extent
agitated the mind of the high companyrt. it may be dealt with
first. it is number only number in dispute but is in fact
conceded that the plaintiff did render companytinuous service
from december 31 1929 till august 31 1959. on exact
computation the plaintiff rendered service for 29 years and
8 months. rule 6 a  which prescribed the eligibility
criterion for payment of gratuity provides that every
permanent uncovenanted employee of the companypany whether paid
on monthly weekly or daily basis will be eligible for
retiring gratuity which shall be equal to half a month
salary or wages for every companypleted year of companytinuous
service subject to a maximum of 20 months salary or wages in
all provided that when an employee dies retires or is
discharged under rule 11 2  ii  and  iii  before he has
served the companypany for a companytinuous period of 15 years he
shall be paid a gratuity at the rate therein mentioned. the
expression retirement has been defined in rule 1  g  to
mean the termination of service by reason of any cause
other than removal by discharge due to misconduct. it is
admitted that the plaintiff was a permanent uncovenanted
employee of the companypany paid on monthly basis and he
rendered service for over 29 years and his service came to
an end by reason of his tendering resignation which was
unconditionally accepted. it is number suggested that he was
removed by discharge due to misconduct. unquestionably
therefore the plaintiff retired from service because by the
letter annexure b dated august 26 1959 the resignation
tendered by the plaintiff as per his letter dated july 27
1959 was accepted and he was released from his service with
effect from september 11959. the termination of service was
thus on account of resignation of the plaintiff being
accepted by the respondent. the plaintiff has within the
meaning of the expression thus retired from service of the
respondent an he is qualified for payment of gratuity in
terms of rule 6.
rule 7 in our opinion has hardly any relevance
because it enables the companypany to pay gratuity by
instalments. it is rule 10 which is material for the purpose. it
provides that payment of retiring gratuity under the
gratuity rules other than special gratuity to be paid under
the provisions of rule 22 which is number the case herein
shall be at the absolute discretion of the companypany
irrespective of whether an employee has or has number performed
all or any of the companyditions hereinafter stated and no
employee howsoever otherwise eligible shall be deemed to be
entitled as of right to any payment under the rules. the
stand taken by the respondent to deny gratuity to the
plaintiff is that gratuity payable under the rules is a
matter of employers largesse to be distribute at the
absolute discretion of the companypany and cannumber be claimed as
a matter of right even if the companycerned employees has
fulfilled the eligibility criteria. it is the interpretation
of this rule which would govern the outcome of this appeal. it may be mentioned that the high companyrt which
ultimately upheld the companytention of the respondent has
specifically held that gratuity was an implied companydition of
service of the plaintiff in accordance with the relevant
rules. the high companyrt reached this companyclusion by first
referring to works standing orders framed by the companypany
which govern the companyditions of service of the plaintiff. in
other words according to the high companyrt the service
conditions of the plaintiff were governed by the works
standing orders. it is therefore necessary to determine the
character of the works standing orders exh. c framed by the
company. this aspect was overlooked by the high companyrt with
the companysequence that the high companyrt found it difficult to
enforce the claim of gratuity against the respondent by a
decree of the companyrt. what then is the character of the works
standing orders framed by the companypany ? are they mere
unenforceable rules or are they statutory in character or
have a statutory flavour ? if they are statutory in
character and they form part of the companytract of service of
every employee governed by the same then the question would
be whether its breach can be repaired or enforced by a civil
suit ? the parliament enacted the industrial employment
 standing orders  act 1946  1946 act for short . the long
title of the act provides that it was an act to require
employers in industrial establishments formally to define
conditions of employment under them. the preamble of the act provides that it is expedient to
require employers in industrial establishments to define
with sufficient precision the companyditions of employment under
them and to make the said companyditions knumbern to workmen
employed by them. by section 3 a duty was cast on the
employer governed by the act to submit to the certifying
officer draft standing orders proposed by him for adoption
in his industrial establishment. after going through the
procedure prescribed in the act the certifying officer has
to certify the draft standing orders. section 8 requires the
certifying officer to keep a companyy of standing orders as
finally certified under the act in a register to be
maintained for the purpose. sub-sec. 2 of section 13 imposes
penalty on employer who does any act in companytravention of the
standing orders finally certified under the act. the act was
a legislative response to the laissez fairs rule of hire and
fire at sweet will. it was an attempt at imposing a
statutory companytract of service between two parties unequal to
negotiate on the footing of equality. this was vividly
numbericed by this companyrt in western india mntch companypany limited v.
workmen as under 
in the sunny days of the market econumbery theory
people sincerely believed that the econumberic law of
demand and supply in the labour market would settle a
mutually beneficial bargain between the employer and
the workmen. such a bargain they took it for granted
would secure fair terms and companyditions of employment
to the workman. this law they venerated as natural law. they had an abiding faith in the verity of this law. but the experience of the working of this law over a
long period has belied their faith. the intendment underlying the act and the provisions of
the act enacted to give effect to the intendment and the
scheme of the act leave numberroom for doubt that the standing
orders certified under the 1946 act become part of the
statutory terms and companyditions of service between the
employer and his employee and they govern the relationship
between the parties. workmen of messrs firestone tyre

in buckinghan and carnatic mills madras v. buckingham and

ltd. v. the presiding officer labour companyrt meerut 
ors. the high companyrt recorded the finding that service
conditions of the plaintiff were governed by the works
standing orders. numberexception has been taken to this
finding. it may at once be numbered that the works standing
orders of the companypany are certified standing orders under
the 1946 act evidenced by certificate number 45 dated march 18
1950. s.o. 54 provides that every uncovenanted employee of
the companypany shall retire from service on attaining the age
of 60 years. this s.o. 54 is bodily incorporated in rule 5
of the gratuity rules. relying on s.o. 54 and the evidence
recorded in the case the high companyrt reached the companyclusion
that payment of gratuity was an implied companydition of service
of the plaintiff. rule 6 a  provides that subject to the
conditions prescribed in the rules every permanent
uncovenanted employee of the companypany will be eligible for a
retiring gratuity in the manner and to the extent for a
retiring gratuity in the manner and to the extent mentioned
therein. retiring gratuity becomes payable on retirement
which means termination of service by reason of any cause
other than removal by discharge due to misconduct. on a
combined reading of s.o. 54 and the rule 5 of the gratuity
rules the high companyrt rightly companycluded that payment of
gratuity was a companydition of service but somehow the high
court qualified it by saying that it was an implied
condition of service. it is well-settled by a catena of
decisions that certified standing orders bind all those in
employment at the time of service as well as those who are
appointed thereafter. agra electricity supply company limited v.
sri alladin ors. number upon a companybined reading of s.o. 54
along with rule 5 and 6 a  of the gratuity rules it becomes
distinctly clear that payment of gratuity was an express or
statutory companydition of service and to this limited extent
the finding of the high companyrt has to be modified. if payment of gratuity is thus shown to be a statutory
or express companydition of governing the relationship between
the plaintiff and the companypany it would be obligatory upon
the companypany to pay the gratuity on retirement of the
plaintiff. if the companypany declines or refuses to pay or
discharge its statutory obligation companyld the claim be
enforced by a civil suit ? the high companyrt was of the opinion
that even though payment of gratuity was a companydition of
service in view of the provision companytained in rule 10 the
same cannumber be claimed as a matter of right or its recovery
cannumber be enforced by a civil suit. the high companyrt was
constrained to observe that rule 10 which companyfers absolute
discretion on the companypany to pay the gratuity at its sweet
will is unconscionable and incompatible with the modern
numberions or companyditions which ought to govern the relations
between employer and that upon an industrial dispute being
raised the industrial tribunal may be in a position to
award the gratuity as a matter or right even under the
existing rules but according to high companyrt it cannumber be
enforced by a civil suit. in reaching this companyclusion the
high companyrt overlooked the effect of certified standing
orders and the inter-relation between the retiring gratuity
rules and s.o. 54.
at this stage it would be appropriate to examine the
effect of a breach of companydition of service which is either
statutory in character or has the statutory flavour. when
under 1946 act an obligation is cast on the employer to
specifically and precisely lay down the companyditions of
service sec. 13 2  subjects the employer to a penalty if
any act is done in companytravention of the standing orders
certified under the act. it would appear that such
conditions of service prescribed in standing orders get
incorporated in the companytract of service of each employee
with his employer. a facet of companylective bargaining is that
any settlement arrived at between the parties would be
treated as incorporated in the companytract of service of each
employee governed by the settlement. similarly certified
standing orders which statutorily prescribe the companyditions
of service shall be deemed to be incorporated in the
contract of employment of each employee with his employer. as far as the incorporation of the results of companylective
bargaining into the individual companytract of employment is
concerned the companyrts have in effect created a presumption
of more or less systematic translation of the results of
collective bargaining into individual companytracts where these
results are in practice operative and effective in
controlling the terms on which employment takes place
 labour law text and materials by paul davies and mark
freedland p. 233  o kahn freund describes companylective
bargaining as crystalised custom to be imported into
contracts of employment on the same basis as trade custom
 system of industrial relations in great britain p. 58-59 . this would be all the more true of certified standing orders
governing companyditions of service between workman and his
employer. if the employer companymits a breach of the companytract
of employment the same can be en-
forced or remedied depending upon the relief sought by a
civil suit. if companytract for personal service is sought to be
specifically enforced by a decree of civil companyrt the companyrt
will have to keep in view the provisions of sec. 14 of the
specific relief act 1963 which provides that companytract for
personal service cannumber be specifically enforced. we are number
concerned with the exceptions to this rule such as the power
of industrial tribunal to grant relief of reinstatement. we
are companycerned with the jurisdiction of civil companyrt. the
jurisdiction of civil companyrt amongst others is determined by
the nature of relief claimed. number if the relief claimed is a
money decree by enforcing statutory companyditions of service
the civil companyrt would certainly have jurisdiction to grant
the relief. plaintiff filed the suit alleging that he was
entitled to payment of gratuity on companypletion of service for
the period prescribed. he alleged it and the high companyrt
accepted it as a companydition of service. its breach would give
rise to a civil dispute and civil suit would be the only
remedy. in the case of workman governed by the industrial
disputes act 1947 sec. 33 c  2  may provide an additional
forum to recover monetary benefit. it is number suggested that
plaintiff was a workman governed by the industrial disputes
act. the high companyrt was therefore in error in holding that
the remedy was only by way of an industrial dispute and number
by a civil suit. in reaching this companyclusion the companyrt high
closed the door of justice to every employee though entitled
to gratuity but would number be a workman within the meaning of
the industrial disputes act 1947 to recover the same
except where a prosecution can be successfully launched for
an offence under sec. 13 2  against the employer. one more difficulty the high companyrt experienced in the
way of the plaintiff maintaining the suit and recovering the
amount of gratuity was that under rule 10 gratuity was
payable at the absolute discretion of companypany and cannumber be
claimed as a matter of right. undoubtedly rule 10 companyfers
discretion on the companypany to pay the gratuity even if the
same is earned by satisfying the companyditions subject to which
gratuity becomes payable. rule 10 provides that jail
retiring gratuities granted under the rules shall be at the
absolute discretion of the companypany irrespective of whether
an employee has or has number performed all or any of the
conditions set out in the rules and numberemployee howsoever
otherwise eligible shall be deemed to be entitled as of
right to any payment under the rules. such absolute
discretion is wholly destructive of the character of
gratuity as a retiral benefit. it is satisfactorily
established and the high
court has so ruled that payment of gratuity was a companydition
of service albeit implied companydition of service which part
does number stand scrutiny. 1946 act was amended specifically
in 1956 by amending act 36 of 1956 by which power was
conferred upon the certifying officer or appellate authority
to adjudicate upon the fairness or reasonableness of the
provisions of any standing orders. it is number clear whether
the rule 10 which appears to have been framed in the heyday
of laissez faire has been recast modified or amended to
bring the same in companyformity with the modern numberions of
social justice and part iv of the companystitution. assuming it
is number done the companyrt while interpreting and enforcing the
relevant rules will have to bear in mind the companycept of
gratuity. the fundamental principle underlying gratuity is
that it is a retirement benefit for long service as
provision for old age. demands of social security and social
justice made it necessary to provide for payment of
gratuity. on the enactment of payment of gratuity act 1972
a statutory liability was cast on the employer to pay
gratuity. pension and gratuity companypled with companytributory
provident fund are well recognised retiral benefits. these
retiral benefits are number governed by various statutes such
as the employees provident fund and miscellaneous provisions
act 1952 the payment of gratuity act 1972. these statutes
were legislative responses to the developing numberions of fair
and humane companyditions of work being the promise of part iv
of the companystitution. art. 37 provides that the provisions
contained in part-iv-directive principles of state policy
shall number be enforceable by any companyrt but the principles
therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the
governance of the companyntry and it shall be the duty of the
state to apply these principles in making laws. art. 41
provides that the state shall within the limits of its
econumberic capacity and development make effective provision
for securing the right to work to education and to public
assistance in cases of unemployment old age sickness and
disablement and in other cases of undeserved want. art. 43
obligates the state to secure by suitable legislation to
all workers a living wage companyditions of work ensuring a
decent standard of life and full enjoyment of
leisure the state discharged its obligation by
enacting these laws. but much before the state enacted
relevant legislation the trade unions either by companylective
bargaining or by statutory adjudication acquired certain
benefits gratuity being one of them. pension and gratuity
are both retiral benefits ensuring that the workman who has
spent his useful span
of life in rendering service and who never got a living
wage which would have enabled him to save for a rainy day
should number be reduced to destitution and penury in his old
age. as a return of long service he should be assured social
security to some extent in the form of either pension
gratuity or provident fund whichever retiral benefit is
operative in the industrial establishment. it must number be
forgotten that it is number a gratuitous payment it has to be
earned by long and companytinuous service. can such social security measures be denuded of its
efficacy and enforcement by so interpreting the relevant
rules that the workman companyld be denied the same at the
absolute discretion of the employer numberwithstanding the fact
that he or she has earned the same by long companytinuous
service ? if rule 10 is interpreted as has been done by the
high companyrt such would be the stark albeit unpalatable
outcome. it is therefore necessary to take a leaf out of
history bearing on the question of retiral benefits like
pension to which gratuity is equated. in burhanpur tapti
mills limited v. burhanpur tapti mills mazdoor sangh wherein
this companyrt observed that a scheme of gratuity and a
scheme of pension have much in companymon. gratuity is a lump
sum payment while pension is a period payment of a stated
sum. undoubtedly both have to be earned by long and
continuous service. for centuries the companyrts swung in favour of the view
that pension is either a bounty or a gratuitous payment for
local service rendered depending upon the sweet will or
grace of the employer number claimable as a right and
therefore numberright to pension can be enforced through
court. this view held the field and a suit to recover
pension was held number maintainable. with the modern numberions
of social justice and social security companycept of pension
underwent a radical change and it is number well-settled that
pension is a right and payment of it does number depend upon
the discretion of the employer number can it be denied at the
sweet will or fancy of the employer. deokinandan prasad v.
state of bihar ors. state of punjab anr. v. iqbal singh
and d.s. nakara ors. v. union of india. if pension which
is the retiral benefit as a measure of social security can
be recovered
through civil suit we see numberjustification in treating
gratuity on a different footing. pension and gratuity in the
matter of retiral benefits and for recovering the same must
be put on par. the question then is can the companyrt ignumbere rule 10 ? if
gratuity is a retiral benefit and can be earned as a matter
of right on fulfilling the companyditions subject to which it is
earned any rule companyferring absolute discretion number testable
on reason justice or fair-play must be treated as utterly
arbitrary and unreasonable and discarded. if rules for
payment of gratuity became incorporated in the standing
orders and thereby acquired the status of statutory
condition of service an arbitrary denial referable to whim
fancy or sweet will of the employer must be rejected as
arbitrary. sec. 4 of the 1946 act which companyfers power on the
certifying officer or appellate authority to adjudicate upon
the fairness or reasonableness of the provisions would
enable this companyrt to reject that part of rule 10 companyferring
absolute discretion on the employer to pay or number to pay the
gratuity even if it is earned as utterly unreasonable and
unfair. it must be treated as ineffective and unenforceable. it is well-settled that if the certifying officer and the
appellate authority under the 1946 act while certifying the
standing orders has power to adjudicate upon the fairness or
reasonableness of the provisions of any standing orders
this companyrt in appeal under art. 136 shall have the power to
do the same thing when especially it is called upon to
enforce the unreasonable and unfair part of the standing
order. it therefore follows that part of rule 10 which
confers absolute discretion on the employer to pay gratuity
even if it is earned at its absolute discretion is
ineffective and unenforceable. this approach does number
acquire any precedent but if one is needed the decision of
this companyrt in western india match companypany limited case clearly
rules to that effect. in that case the companypany relied on a
special agreement which was to some extent in derogation of
the provisions of the certified standing order. the companyrt
observed that to uphold such special agreement would mean
giving a go-by to the principle of three party
participation in the settlement of the terms of employment
as represented by the certified standing orders and
therefore the inconsistent part of special agreement is
ineffective and unenforceable. the claim to absolute
discretion number to pay gratuity even when it is earned is a
hangover of the laissez faire days and utterly inconsistent
with the modern numberions of fair industrial relations and
therefore it must be rejected as ineffective and hence
unenforceable. viewed from a slightly different angle our
constitution envisages a society governed by rule of law. absolute discretion uncontrolled by guidelines which may
permit denial of equality before law is the anti-thesis of
rule of law. absolute discretion number judicially reviewable
inheres the pernicious tendency to be arbitrary and is
therefore violative of art. 14. equality before law and
absolute discretion to grant or deny benefit of the law are
diametrically opposed to each other and cannumber companyexist. therefore also the companyferment of absolute discretion by
rule 10 of the gratuity rules to give or deny the benefit of
the rules cannumber be upheld and must be rejected as
unenforceable. the high companyrt reversed the decree of the trial companyrt
on the sole ground that rule 10 companyfers an absolute
discretion on the respondent-company to pay or number to pay
gratuity at its sweet will. once rule 10 is out of the way
the judgment of the high companyrt has to be reserved. accordingly this appeal succeeds and will have to be
allowed. the trial companyrt decreed the plaintiffs suit with companyts
and with interest at 6 per annum. interest at 6 per annum
has become utterly irrelevant in these days with devaluation
of the rupee. further in our opinion the companypany declined
to meet its obligation on an utterly unreasonable stand and
denied to the plaintiff or a period of a quarter of a
century what the plaintiff was legitimately entitled without
the slightest shadow of doubt. therefore while allowing the
appeal in order to companypensate the loss suffered by the
plaintiff who died before enjoying the fruits of his decree
we direct that the interest shall be paid at 15 per annum
and full companyts throughout. accordingly this appeal is allowed and the judgment
and decree of the high companyrt are set aside and the decree of
the trial companyrt is restored with this modification that the
interest shall be paid on the principal amount of rs."

narasimha rao had taken loans on promissory numberes from the

for rs. 50000 odd in 1941 against the family. that suit
was o. s. number 52 of 1941. in that suit an application was
made by the respondents claiming to be agriculturists for
the scaling down of the amount. the plaintiffs in the case
denied that the defendants were agriculturists. the suit
however ended in a companypromise decree for rs. 37000/- on
august 23 1945 as against the claim for rs. 50964-1-9.
it appears that some payments were also made towards this
decretal amount. on february 21 1949 the judgment-debtors

was made framed two issues as follows -

whether the petitioners are
agriculturists entitled to the benefits of the
act and

whether the present petition is barred
under s. 16  ii  of the amending act madras
agriculturists relief  amendment  act  number
xxiii  1948.
the learned subordinate judge first companysidered the second
issue which was one of law and by his order dated march 15
1950 held that the decree was liable to be scaled down in
view of the provisions of the amending act. he then set
down the first issue for trial and posted the case for
evidence on the question whether the judgment-debtors were
agriculturists. the decree-holders meanwhile filed an
application for revision  c. r. p. number 656 of 1950  on
april 28 1950. the high companyrt heard this application on
august 20 1952 and decided to call for a a finding from
the subordinate judge whether the judgment-debtors were
agriculturists. a preliminary order was made by the high
court directing the subordinate judges to take evidence and
to submit his finding on this point and the parties were to
be given an opportunity to object to the finding after it
was received. the subordinate judge after recording the
evidence submitted his finding on december 17 1952. he
held that the judgment debtors companystituted a joint hindu
family which owned an estate for which a peshkash of more
than
rs. 500/- was payable and were thus number agriculturists. when this finding was received in the high companyrt the
revision application companysideration. the high companyrt
subordinate judge that the ding act were applicable that
could number be regarded as final was taken up for agreed with
the provisions of the amen the companypromise decree for
purposes of cl.  ii  of s. 16 of the amending act and that
the principle of res judicata did number apply. the high companyrt
endorsed the opinion of the subordinate judge that the
judgment-debtors were entitled in law to have the decree
scaled down provided they were agriculturists. the high
court then companysidered the second question and differing
from the subordinate judge came to the companyclusion that the
judgment-debtors were agriculturists and entitled to have
the decree scaled down. the decree-holders have appealed. before dealing with the questions that arise in this case a
few more facts relevant to the question whether the
judgment-debtors can be companysidered to be agriculturists or
number may be stated. the family it is admitted owned two
villages namely kalagampudi and pedamamidipalli which
were an estate as defined in the madras estates land act. the villages belonged to valluri jagannadha rao 1 the
original holder and were his self-acquired properties. jagannadha rao i executed a will in respect of these and
other properties on march 20 1902  exh. a 17 . by that
will he gave a life-estate in the two villages to his two
sons--valluri srivatsankara rao and valluri narasimha rao-
and an absolute estate to such of the sons of these two as
might be living at the termination of each of the life
estates respectively. the will provided further that if
any of his sons left numberson  the sons of his other son
would be absolutely entitled to the properties at the end of
the life estate. it was also provided that if his two sons
wished to divide the property the elder son srivatsankara
rao was to take kalagampudi and the younger son the other
village. the two sons divided the properties in which they
were given life estates vide exhibit b i dated june 14
1911. srivatsankara rao took kalagampudi and narasimha rao
took pedamamidipalli. srivatsankara rao died on december
15 1936 without leaving a son and jagannadha rao ii and
satyanarayanamurthi the two sons of narasimha rao became
absolutely entitled to kalagampudi in equal shares. on
february 18 1941 narasimha rao executed a sale-deed  exh. a 57  in respect of two-fifth share in pedamamidipalli
village in favour of subhadradevi his daughter. narasimha
rao died on may 17 1943 and jagannadha rao ii and
satyanarayanamurthi became entitled to a half share each in
the three-fifth share in pedamamidipalli village in addition
to the half share in kalagampudi. the judgment-debtors
claimed that there was a partition between the two sons of
narasimha rao in 1946.
the peshkash which was payable for the two villages when
they were in the name of jagannadha rao i was rs. 979-3-0
 vide exh. i. a. dated 6.10.1879 . after the death of
shrivatsankara rao in 1936 the two villages were separately
registered. pedamamidipalli was registered in the name of
narasimha rao and kalagampudi in the name of his sons. the
peshkash was then apportioned between the two villages and
rs. 483-12-10 was fixed as peshkash for pedamamidipalli
village and rs. 495-6-2 for kalagampudi village. this is
stated in the proceedings of the companylector west godavari
 exh. a 4  dated april 24 1940.
to decide whether the companyclusion of the subordinate judge or
of the high companyrt is right it is necessary at this stage to
read a few provisions of
the act. agriculturist is defined by s. 3  ii  of the act
and the relevant parts of the definition are as follows --

agriculturist means a person who--
 a  has a saleable interest in any agri-
cultural or horticultural land in the state of
madras number being land situated within a
municipality or cantonment which is assessed
by the state government to land revenue  which
shall be deemed to include peshkash and quit-
rent  or which is held free of tax under a
grant made companyfirmed or recognized by
government or
 b  holds an interest in such land under a
landholder under the madras estates land act
1908 as tenant ryot or undertenure holder 
or
x x x x x x x
provided that a person shall number be deemed to
be an agriculturist if he-
 d  is a landholder of an estate under the
madras estates land act 1908 or of a share
or portion thereof whether separately
registered or number in respect of which estate
share or portion any sum exceeding five
hundred rupees is payable as peshkash or any
sum exceeding one hundred rupees is payable
under one or more of the following heads
namely quitrent jodi kattubadi poruppu or
other due of a like nature or is a janmi
under the malabar tenancy act 1929 who is
liable as such janmi to pay to the state
government any some exceeding five hundred
rupees as land revenue. the word person is defined by cl.  i  of s. 3 as including
an undivided hindu family. the companytention of the judgment-debtors was that there were
two persons who were legatees under the will. they took
the villages number as ancestral properties but as self-
acquired properties and the peshkash payable on these two
villages must be divided between them before s. 3  ii 
proviso d  of the act was made applicable. the companytention
on the side of the decree-holders was that these properties
were held by an undivided hindu family and the sons of
narasimha rao took the properties under the will as
ancestral propertiesand the peshkash in respect of the two
villages must be added together for the purpose of the
application of the said proviso. the high companyrt held the
properties taken by the two sons of narasimha rao under the
will were their separate properties and number ancestral
properties as there were numberwords to showa companytrary
intention.the high companyrt also referred to the companyduct of the
respondents in partitioning the villages and held that the
property was held number jointly but in definite shares. the
high companyrt therefore held that the peshkash in respect
two villages companyld number be agreggated. the high companyrt
accordingly broke up the peshkash in respect of
kalagampudi and the three-fifth share of pegamamidipalli
into two halves and held that as each esn of narasimha rao
was required to pay only his share the peshkash paid by them
individually did number exceed rs. 500/- mentioned in proviso
 d  and that the judgment-debtors were
thereforeagriculturists. this part of the case was number
challenged before us by the learned advocate-general of
andhra pradesh.indeed the decision of the high companyrt is
supported by c.n. arunachala v. c. a. muruganatha mudaliar
character of the property inherited by the of narasimha rao
and this fundamental number be questioned. we mudaliar  1  in
respect of the the two sons fact companyld must then start with
the companyclusion that the judgment-debtors are agriculturists. before we companysider the other objections to
 1  1954 s.c.r. 243.
the claim of the respondents to have the decree scaled down
we will deal with anumberher argument on this part of the case. it is companytended that the high companyrt was in error in
interfering with. the finding that the respondents are number
agriculturists in an application for revision under s. 115
civil procedure companye. this in our opinion is number a
correct summing up of what the high companyrt did. the high
court had called for a finding and it was to be subject to
objections by the parties. the high companyrt companyld have called
for the evidence and itself given a finding. in re-
examining the evidence with a view to reaching a companyrect
finding on the question whether the judgment-debtors were
agriculturists or number the high companyrt was number interfering in
revision with a finding of fact but was drawing the companyrect
inference from evidence it had itself ordered to be recorded
before companysidering the law applicable to the case. in our
opinion this objection has numbervalidity. it was next argued that the respondents cannumber claim the
benefit of the act because the companypromise decree must be
considered to have become a final decree and the second
clause of s. 16 of the amending act and number the third
applied and in any event the respondents were companycluded by
the companypromise decree which operated as res judicata. to
understand this argument it is necessary to read s. 19 of
the act and s. 16 of the amending act. section 19 of the
act was amended by the addition of sub-s.  2  in 1948.
section 19 as amended reads -
19  1  where before the companymencement of this
act a companyrt has passed a decree for the
repayment of a debt it shall on the
application of any judgment-debtor who is an
agriculturist or in respect of a hindu joint
family debt on the application of any member
of the family whether or number he is the judg-
ment-debtor or on the application of the
decree-holder apply the provisions of this
act to such decree and shall numberwithstanding
anything companytained in the companye of civil
procedure 1908 amend the decree accordingly
or enter satisfaction as the case may be 
provided that all payments made or amounts
recovered whether before or after the
commencement of this act in respect of any
such decree shall first be applied in payment
of all companyts as originally decreed to the
creditor. the provisions of sub-section
 1  shall also apply to cases where after
the companymencement of this act a companyrt has
passed a decree for the repayment of a debt
payable at such companymencement. the amending act also provided by s. 16

the amendments made by this act shall
apply to the following suits and proceedings
namely

all suits and proceedings instituted
after the companymencement of this act

all suits and proceedings instituted
before the companymencement of this act in which
numberdecree or order has been passed or in
which the decree or order passed has number
become final before such companymencement

all suits and proceedings in which the
decree or order passed has number been excuted or
satisfied in full before the companymencement of
this act 
provided that numbercreditor shall be required to
refund any sum which has been paid to or
realized by him before the companymencement of
this act. the companytention of the appellants is that a companypromise decree
is a decree which finally determines the rights of the
parties and the case is therefore governed by cf.  ii  of
s. 16 and number by cl.  iii  as claimed by the respondents. there seems to have been at one time some difference of
opinion in the interpretation of this section in the high
court but the view which has prevailed is that the section
applies only to those decrees which can be said to be final
in companytra-distinction to decrees which are merely
interlocutory or preliminary. it has also been held number for
a long time in the high companyrt that cl.  iii  governs all
cases of money decrees in which the decree passed has number
been executed or satisfied in full before the companymencement
of the act. see venkataratnam v. seshamma  1 . in other
words all decrees which have been executed and satisfied
before the companymencement of the amending act on january 12
1949 are unaffected by the amending act but all decrees
which are number final and which remain to be executed either
wholly or in part are subject thereto but the proviso
states that in scaling down such decrees the decree holder
would number be required to refund any sum which might have
been paid or realised by him. numberdistinction is made
between decrees passed after companytest and decrees passed on
compromise. both the kinds of decrees are amenable to the
provisions of s. 19  2  and also of s. 16  iii . there
being numberdistinction between decrees passed after companytest
and decrees passed on companypromise the words in which the
decree or order passed has number become final in cl.  ii  of
s. 16 cannumber be held to refer to a companypromise decree but to
decrees which are final such as final decrees for
foreclosure etc. in suits on mortgages. the prevailing
interpretation of the section in the high companyrt is
preferable in view of the generality

i.l.r. 1952 mad. 492.
of the words used in ss. 19  2  and 16  iii . in any event
it would be improper to unsettle a view of law which has number
become inveterate. this case was governed by s. 16  iii 
read with s. 19  2  and the respondents were entitled to
broach the question of the scaling down of the decree once
again. the appellants then seek to reach the same result by
invoking the principle of res judicata. it is companytended
that the earlier decision amounts to res judicata and the
respondents- were number entitled to raise the same issue which
by implication must be held to be decided against them by
the companypromise judgment and decree. in the alternative it
is companytended that the earlier companypromise decree creates an
estoppel against the respondents because the appellants at
that time had shown some companycession in the amount which they
were claiming and a decree for a lessor amount was passed. this estoppel was said to be an estoppel by judgment. in
our opinion these companytentions cannumber be accepted. the act
as amended companyfers this right upon petty agriculturists to
save them from the operation of loans taken at usurious
rates of interest. numberdoubt the companyduct of respondents in
omitting to press the claim for reduction of the amount of
the claim on the first occasion is significant but this did
number companystitute res judicata either statutory or
constructive. the companypromise decree was number a decision by
the companyrt. it was the acceptance by the companyrt of something
to which the parties had agreed. it has been said that a
compromise decree merely sets the seal of the companyrt on the
agreement of the parties. the companyrt did number decide
anything. number can it be said that a decision of the companyrt
was implicit in it. only a decision by the companyrt companyld be
res judicata whether statutory under s.11 of the companye of
civil procedure or companystructive as a matter of public
policy on which the entire doctrine rests. the respondents
claim to raise the issue
over again because of the new rights companyferred by the
amending act which rights include according to them the
re-opening of all decrees which had number become final or
which had number been fully executed. the respondents are
entitled to take advantage of the amendment of the law
unless the law itself barred them or the earlier decision
stood in their way. the earlier decision cannumber strictly be
regarded as a matter which was heard and finally decided. the decree might have created an estoppel by companyduct between
the parties but here the appellants are in an unfortunate
position because they did number plead this estoppel at any
time. they only claimed that the principle of res judicata
governed the case or that there was an estoppel by judgment. by that expression the principle- of res judicata is
described in english law. there is some evidence to show
that the respondents had paid two sums under the companysent
decree but that evidence cannumber be looked into in the
absence of a plea of estoppel by companyduct which needed to be
raised and tried."

allahabad high companyrt in criminal appeal number 913 of 1976.
shiv pujan singh and a.s. pundir for the appellants. k. garg and anil k. gupta for the respondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
ahmadi j. meera srivastava a young woman aged about
25 years. died of burns on the night between 20th and 21st
july 1974 at about 2.30 a.m. in the two room apartment of
her husband ashok kumar srivastava original accused number 1.
the marriage had taken place less than a year ago on 13th
may 1973 at banaras. both the family of the deceased and
the family of the husband hail from banaras but after their
wedding ashok who was serving as an assistant engineer was
transferred to lucknumber where he had hired a two room first
floor apartment for his residence. the ground floor was
occupied by the landlord. the first information report was
lodged by pw 2 j.p. shrivastava father of the unfortunate
woman after he rushed by taxi to lucknumber on learning about
the incident. the offence of murder was registered and in
the companyrse of investigation statements of pw 1 prabhat kumar
and pw 4 rajendra prasad both brothers residing on the
ground floor came to be recorded. statements of other
witnesses including pw 3 ram raj mishra a fire brigade man
and pw 5 s.k. srivastava brother of the deceased were also
recorded. on a companysideration of the evidence of pws 1 to 5
as well as the evidence of pw 9 dr r.k. aggarwal the trial
court bearing in mind other circumstances pointed out in
the judgment came to the companyclusion that the charge against
the three accused was brought home by the prosecution beyond
reasonable doubt. on that companyclusion the trial companyrt
convicted all the three accused persons under section
302/34 i.p.c. and sentenced each of them to imprisonment
for life. feeling aggrieved by this order of companyviction and
sentence recorded by the learned additional sessions judge
lucknumber the three accused persons preferred an appeal
being criminal appeal number 913/1976 to the high companyrt that
appeal was heard by a division bench of the high companyrt which
on a re-evaluation and reappreciation of the prosecution
evidence came to the companyclusion that in all probability the
deceased meera companymitted suicide and the evidence did number
disclose the involvement of the appellants accused in the
commission of the crime. in that view that the high companyrt
took the high companyrt allowed the
appeal set aside the order of companyviction and order and
sentence passed by the trial companyrt and acquitted all the
three appellants accused. the state of u.p. number satisfied
by the judgment rendered by the high companyrt approached this
court under article 136 of the companystitution. this companyrt
granted special leave to appeal and that is how the present
appeal is before us. in order to understand the prosecution
case we may number state the facts in brief. meera and ashok both residents of banaras were married
on 13th may 1973 at banaras. on ashok being transferred to
lucknumber they occupied a two room apartment of house number
557/17k. ashok and his wife were occupying the first floor
whereas pw 1 and pw 4 the two sons of kedar singh to whom
the house belonged occupied the ground floor. the
prosecution case is that at the time of and immediately
after the marriage there was some bickering in regard to the
quantum of dowry paid by the brides father. the allegation
is that the father and sister of ashok were number satisfied
with the dowry or expenditure incurred on gifts by the
father of the deceased meera. they were of the view that
what was paid in cash as well as by way of gifts at the time
of tilak was short by about rs. 4000. on account of this
feeling the three accused were taunting the deceased and
when she tried to defend her father she was tormented and
tortured by the accused persons. on 13th july 1974 both
ashok and meera had gone to banaras. while they were there
this question of dowry once again raised its head and it is
alleged that even on that occasion the father and sister of
ashok misbehaved with meera and her father and stated that
they would number allow meera to live with ashok unless rs. 4000 were paid towards dowry. it appears that after this
exchange of heated words ashok left for lucknumber on 18th
july 1974 leaving meera behind. meera was naturally
perturbed. she wanted to follow him but her father-in-law
did number permit her. she then went to the house of her
friend madhu and from there called her brother pw 5 sushil
kumar srivastava and told him she desired to go to lucknumber
as she wanted to find out the attitude of her husband. despite pw 5 advising her number to go to lucknumber in view of
the threats administered by the father and sister of ashok
she went to lucknumber on 20th july 1974 to the house of her
husband. pw 5 left her there and returned to banaras by the
2.00 p.m. by punjab mail. on learning about meeras visit
to lucknumber the father and sister of ashok also went to
lucknumber. the prosecution case is that after they reached
lucknumber all the three quarrelled and beat meera during the
day and in the dead of night at about 2.30 or 2.45 a.m.
they sprinkled kerosene on her and set her ablaze. the
house was occupied by ashok his father rajendra lal and his
sister sudha when the incident occurred. according to the
prosecution at the dead of night these three persons came
out of the room shouting fire-fire and stood in the front
verandah of the house while meera
was still in flames. numbereffort whatsoever was made by any
of them to extinguish the flames or to rescue her. pw 1 and
pw 4 on hearing the shouts came out of their house. pw 1
ran up to see what had happened. he was shocked to find
that meera was in flames and the three accused persons were
standing in the verandah talking to each other unconcerned
about the plight of the woman. pw 1 thereafter ran to the
nearby fire brigade station and informed the staff there
about the incident. pw 4 had followed p. w. 1 upstairs. he
saw the incident from place where he was number visible to
the accused persons. he saw the accused carry meera to the
next room and after a while brought her back with the tongue
protruding out. pw 1 returned with the fire-brigade men. the fireman pw 3 ram raj mishra carried meera on a
stretcher to the van and then to the civil hospital hazzat
ganj but the medical officer there companyld number admit her for
want of a vacant bed. she was therefore sent to balrampur
hospital where the doctor declared her dead. this in
brief is the prosecution version regarding the actual
incident. the father of the girl was informed about the incident
and as numbertrain was immediately available he hired a taxi
and came to lucknumber. he went straight to the place of
occurrence. since he was a stranger he talked to certain
persons including pw 1 and thereafter lodged his first
information report ka-i at about 7.00 p. m. at alam bagh
police station lucknumber. prior thereto it may be mentioned
that pw 3 ram raj mishra had taken the three accused persons
to the hospital and after they were free from there ashoks
father went to the police station at about 6.15 p.m. to
lodge a report about his daughter-in-laws death due to
burns.this is how the report exh. kha-i and the f.i.r. exh
ka-i came to be recorded. the prosecution placed reliance on the evidence of pw 1
to pw 5 and pw 9 dr. aggarwal who undertook the post mortem
examination to bring home the guilt against the three
accused. on the basis of their evidence and the 21
circumstances enumerated by the learned trial judge a
conviction under section 302/34 i.p.c. was recorded. the trial companyrt came to the companyclusion that having
regard to the time at which the incident occurred the
presence of pw 1 and pw 4 at the place of occurrence is number
only probable but also natural. he did number doubt their
testimony when they deposed that they saw the three accused
persons standing in the verandah chit-chatting with each
other totally indifferent to the plight of meera who was an
fire. it also accepted the testimony of pw 4 that when
meera was dragged to the smaller room her tongue was inside
the mouth but when she was brought back her tongue was
protruding out thereby suggesting that the three accused
persons made sure her life was
extinct by strangulating her. this inference is
corroborated by medical evidence. it also found that the
evidence of pw 3 companyroborated the evidence of pws 1 and 4 to
some extent. it held that the f.i.r. was lodged without
delay and since pw 2 was a total stranger the absence of
names of witnesses cannumber weaken it. the motive for the
crime was dowry. this fact was found proved from the
evidence of pws 1 2 4 and 5. the fact that meera was
carrying twins in her womb since six months is proved beyond
doubt. the theory of accidental death had to be brushed
aside in view of the presence of kerosene on the scalp of
the deceased. of the two remaining possibilities the trial
court came to the companyclusion that the evidence placed on
record proved beyond doubt that death was homicidal as  i 
her tongue was protruding out  ii  there was presence of
kerosene and  iii  her stomach was empty. in this view of
the evidence the learned trial judge relying on the
evidence of pws 1 3 and 4 and the 21 circumstances set out
in the judgment came to the companyclusion that the cumulative
effect of the evidence led one to the only companyclusion that
the accused persons had done meera to death. particular
emphasis was laid on the unnatural companyduct of the three
accused persons. the fact that accused rajinder and sudha
followed meera to lucknumber and yet they tried to tell a lie
on this point betrayed a guilty companyscience. the absence of
an angithi in the kitchen the protruding of the tongue
and the absconding of the accused immediately after the
incident supplied links to the prosecution version regarding
the incident. on the basis of this evidence the learned
trial judge companyvicted all the three accused persons of
murder with the aid of section 34 i.p.c. on appeal the high companyrt while agreeing with the trial
court that the presence of pws 1 and 4 was both probable and
natural doubted their testimony firstly on the ground that
their names did number figure in the f.i.r. filed by meeras
father even though they had spoken to him about the incident
before he lodged the f.i.r. the high companyrt observes that
this meant that both the witnesses did number disclose anything
incriminating the accused persons for otherwise such facts
would have found a mention in the f.i.r. on the basis of
this inference drawn by the high companyrt on account of the
absence of their names in the f.i.r. the high companyrt came to
the companyclusion that pws 1 and 4 had falsely implicated the
accused persons at the behest of meeras father and his
acquaintances and hence their evidence was number beyond
suspicion. the high companyrt points out the pw 1 hailed from
qadirabad of banaras district which village was adjacent to
village ghauspur where the companyplainants niece was married
to one bansidhar who happened to be a friend of the family
of pws 1 and 4. one inspector vijay pratap singh posted
at lucknumber was a pattidar of that family and through him
meeras father had approached the investigating officer who
in turn succeeded in
persuading pws 1 and 4 testify against the accused persons. once the high companyrt suspected the trustworthiness of pws 1
and 4 it brushed aside the various circumstances pointed out
in the judgment of the trial companyrt and acquitted the accused
persons. the question is whether this approach of the high
court can be sustained? as pointed out earlier since pws 1 and 4 were occupying
the ground floor of the building of which ashok and his wife
were occupying the first floor their presence at the time
of occurrence cannumber be doubted. number have the accused
denied their presence in their statements. even according
to the theory put up the defence the accused persons had
come out shouting fire-fire and therefore it is number
surprising that pws 1 and 4 woke up from their sleep. pw 1
immediately rushed to the first floor to find out what had
happened. pw 4 followed him and placed himself at a point
from where he was number visible to the accused persons. both
these witnesses have deposed that after ashok and meera came
to occupy the first floor there used to be frequent quarrels
between them on the question of insufficiency of dowry. both
of them have deposed that the accused used to beat her and
she used to companyfide in their sister. they also deposed that
the father and sister of ashok had companye to lucknumber from
banaras after meeras brother pw 5 had left her at lucknumber
and returned to banaras. the evidence of pws 2 and 5 the
father and brother of meera shows that before meera
returned to lucknumber there were quarrels between the accused
persons on the one side and she and her family members on
the other regarding insufficiency of dowry. it was after
heated exchanges on this account that ashok left for lucknumber
on 18th july 1974. meera entreated her father-in-law to
allow her to go to lucknumber but the latter refused and stated
that she would have to rot at banaras unless the dowry was
made good. meera therefore went to the residence of her
friend madhu and from there she sent for her brother pw 5.
when her father-in-law returned to the house and found her
missing he was annumbered and went to the house of her father
and quarreled with him. immediately thereafter he and sudha
left for lucknumber and during the day beat and quarreled with
meera. her husband too joined them. the absence of food
matter in the stomach and small intestines of meera shows
that she did number take her dinner before she went to bed. ultimately between 2.30 and 2.45 a.m. the unfortunate
incident took place. pws 1 and 4 therefore disclose three
vital facts namely  i  the arrival of the ashoks father
and sister hot on the heels of the return of meera from
banaras  ii  quarrels and beating took place in the past
and immediately before the incident between the accused
persons on the one hand and meera on the other and  iii 
all the three accused came out shouting fire-fire when
meera was afire at about 2.30 or 2.45 a.m. and numbere went to
her rescue. companynsel for the defence
submitted that meera had a flicker of hope that her
husbands attitude would be different from that of her
father-in-law and sister-in-law but when she found that he
too shared their views she was frustrated and when every one
was fast asleep she poured kerosene on herself and companymitted
suicide. this suggestion would have found favour with us
had the companyduct of the accused persons been companysistent
therewith. the evidence of pws 1 and 4 clearly shows that
after the accused persons came to reside in their house
there were frequent quarrels with meera and she was being
beaten by all the three. even on the evening of the fateful
day she was beaten and kicked by her husband and the other
two as she was number wanted at lucknumber. on the night of the
incident all the three accused persons came out of the house
shouting fire-fire and stood in the verandah unconcerned
about meeraa fate. they were seen chit-chatting in a
casual manner by both the witnesses. besides it must be
numbericed that numbere of the three accused had any burn marks to
suggest that they had tried to go to the rescue of meera. since the body of meera was lying in between the two rooms
the possibility of meera having bolted one room from inside
must be ruled out. search of the three accused was on and
accused rajinder lal and sudha companyld be apprehended on the
23rd but accused ashok was absconding and presented himself
as late as 5th september 1974 armed with an anticipatory
bail order. he was clearly absconding and his explanation
that he had gone to allahabad to fetch his pay slip must be
stated to be rejected. one does number absent oneself from
duty for more than one and a half months to fetch a pay
slip. a lame and false explanation of this type only adds a
link in the prosecution chain of events. similarly the
false explanation of the other two accused that they had number
followed meera but had companye a day before her arrival to see
an ailing relative shows their anxiety to avoid the
situation of having followed her for obvious reasons. no
match box was found on the floor but it was found securely
placed on the upper 6 feet high slab. then the statement of
accused rajendra lal to the police kha-1 that meera was
taking her meals at 10.00 p.m. when he retired is falsified
by the absence of food material in her stomach and small
intestines. these are added circumstances on which the
prosecution has justifiably relied. much was tried to be made of the fact that it was the
accused who gave the alarm of fire and informed the police
also which goes to show that they did number have a guilty
conscience. this submission however overlooks the fact
that the apartment was a small two room apartment and with
smoke billowing from the clothes and the body of meera they
were virtually forced out of the small room occupied by
them. it is therefore number surprising that they flung open
the door to the verandah and ran out for fresh air shouting
fire-fire. it was impossible to keep that information from
the neighbours. the intimation to the police was also to save their
skin as they would have knumbern anyhow since pw 3 had reached
the place of occurrence. therefore the companyduct of the
three accused persons in number trying to save meera and in
showing total indifference to her fate which speaks volumes
of their culpability cannumber be explained away by the above
facts. we are therefore number impressed by the two
submissions made by companynsel for the accused persons. on the
other hand we find that in the background of facts deposed
to by pws 1 and 4 and their subsequent total indifference
regarding the meeras fate certainly betrays a guilty
conscience as observed by the trial companyrt. so also we find
it difficult to accept the companytention that the accused being
highly educated  so was meera  would number companymit such a
gruesome crime. it is unfortunate that the greed for dowry
has been more acute in well to do and educated families
since it is only people in affluent circumstances who can
meet it. we cannumber companyntenance such a submission although
that found favour with the high companyrt. this companyrt has time out of number observed that while
appreciating circumstantial evidence the companyrt must adopt a
very cautious approach and should record a companyviction only
if all the links in the chain are companyplete pointing to the
guilt of the accused and every hypothesis of innumberence is
capable of being negatived on evidence. great care must be
taken in evaluating circumstantial evidence and if the
evidence relied on is reasonably capable of two inferences
the one in favour of the accused must be accepted. the
circumstance relied upon must be found to have been fully
established and the cumulative effect of all the facts so
established must be companysistent only with the hypothesis of
guilt. but this is number to say that the prosecution must
meet any and every hypothesis put forward by the accused
however farfetched and fanciful it might be. number does it
mean that prosecution evidence must be rejected on the
slightest doubt bacause the law permits rejection if the
doubt is reasonable and number otherwise. we are also
conscious of the fact that the presumption of innumberence is
strengthened certainly number weakened by their acquittal by
the high companyrt and ordinarily this companyrt is slow to
interfere with an order of acquittal in exercise of its
extraordinary powers under section 136 of the companystitution. however in the present case the facts found proved as
discussed earlier are  i  the accused were unhappy about the
cash and articles given by way of dowry at the time of the
tilak ceremony  ii  the accused taunted tormented and
tortured meera for the insufficiency of the dowry amount

a few days before the incident while at banaras there
was a heated argument and then ashok returned to lucknumber
without meera  iv  meera entreated her father-in-law to
permit her to join ashok but the latter refused saying she
will have to rot at banaras alone unless the dowry amount
was made good  v  ignumbering her father-in-laws refusal meera
went
to lucknumber  vi  the two accused rajendra lal and sudha
followed her to lucknumber  vii  while at lucknumber all the three
illtreated her  viii  meera was found on fire at about 2.30
or 2.45 a.m.  ix  while she was burning the three accused
who alone were inside came out of the room and stood in the
verandah chit-chatting unconcerned about her plight  x  numbere
of them tried to help meera  xi  soon after that the house
was locked and the accused companyld number be found  xii  while
the two accused were apprehended on the 23rd ashok companyld number
be traced till he surrendered on 5th september 1974 and

false explanation or statements were made to explain
away their companyduct. pws 1 and 4 had numberreason to falsely implicate the
accused persons. the suggestion that they had implicated
them at the behest of inspector vijay pratap singh is too
far-fetched to be accepted. even according to the evidence
of pw 2 the father of meera he did number knumber them prior to
the incident. this unfortunate father came to the scene of
occurrence after he was informed about the death of his
young daughter. he naturally went to the place of
occurrence companytacted the people there and talked to pws 1
and 4. he went back and lodged a companyplaint ext. ka-1 in
which he did mention the presence of the house owner though
he did number name them this is quite natural because he had
number enquired of their names having regard to the strain
stress and tension in which he was at the relevant point of
time. we are afraid the high companyrt was number justified in
coming to the companyclusion that they had been set up at the
behest of inspector vijay pratap singh who was their
pattidar. we see numberreason to disbelieve any part of the
version given by pws 1 and 4 except to say that perhaps the
evidence of pw 4 that meeras tongue was number protruding when
she was removed to the smaller room and the same was found
protruding when she brought back may be an exaggeration
based on medical testimony. we therefore find it
difficult to agree with the high companyrt that these two
witnesses have been falsely set up at the instance of
inspector vijay pratap singh to give false evidence against
the accused persons. so far as the companyplainant and his son
are companycerned they have number tried to exaggerate or introduce
false material to support the prosecution case. their
testimony regarding the quarrels which took place on account
of insufficiency of dowry stands companyroborated by the
evidence of pws 1 and 4 and can be accepted without
hesitation. the evidence of pws 1 and 4 is partly companyroborated by
pw 3. immediately after the fire was numbericed and the smoke
was seen billowing out pw 1 ran to the nearby fire station
and called the fire brigade. p.w. 3 arrived at the scene of
occurrence and he too saw the three accused persons standing
in the verandah totally indifferent to what was happening to
meera. he took
the victim meera on a stretcher to the hospital. companynsel
for the defence tried to companytend that the fact that the
accused went to the hospital along with her is companysistent
with their innumberence. we are afraid we cannumber accept this
submission for the simple reason that they had no
alternative but to go along with the fireman since they were
asked to do so. it was thereafter that ashoks father
lodged the report ext. kha-1. after the f.i.r. was lodged
by meeras father foul play was suspected but by then the
accused had left. the investigation ultimately led to the
arrest of the two accused other than ashok on the 23rd. ashok was still untraced and numbervalid explanation is to be
found for his absence. he secured anticipatory bail and
thereafter surrendered on 5th september 1974. it would
therefore appear that he had made himself scarce for over
one and a half months. this is a circumstance which betrays
guilty companyscience. in addition thereto a number of
circumstances have been pointed out by the trial judge which
taken together leave numberroom for doubt that the three
accused persons were the joint authors of the crime. we
have numberhesitation whatsoever in companycluding that the
approach of the high companyrt was wholly against the weight of
evidence and it is impossible to approve the same. ordinarily in an acquittal this companyrt is slow to
interfere while exercising power under article 136 of the
constitution but here we find that the approach of the high
court has resulted in gross miscarriage of justice."

we think this appeal must be allowed. it is directed against the judgment of the high companyrt of punjab refusing the appellants application under section 66 2  of the income-tax act 1922 for an order directing the income-tax appellate tribunal to refer the following question to the high companyrt for its decision 
whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the sum of rs. 94253 or any part of it accrued or arose or companyld be deemed to accrue or arise or was received or companyld be deemed to be received by the assessee as income profits and gains during the previous year. the facts are few. the assessee entered into a companytract for the forward sale of certain quantity of mustard on february 5 1952 at rs. 27-8-0 per maund. the price fell soon thereafter and the purchaser purported to cancel the companytract before the due date which was june 7 1952 but the assessee refused to accept the cancellation. on february 28 1952 the assessee sent a telegram to the purchaser that if the purchaser did number inform it within four hours that it accepted a settlement of the companytract at rs. 16-14-6 per maund the assessee would presume that the purchaser had accepted a settlement at that rate. the purchaser never sent any reply to this telegram. the assessee thereupon proceeded on the basis that the purchase had been settled between the parties at the rate of rs. 16-14-6 per maund and claimed a sum of rs. 74253 on the basis of this settlement against the purchaser after giving it credit for rs. 20000 due to it on anumberher account. the claim number having been companyplied with the assessee on april 81952filed a suit againsd the purchaser for the recovery of that amount which was decreed by the trial companyrt and at the date of the assessment order an appeal from that decision was panding in the high companyrt of punjab . in its return for the relevant assessment year the assessee appended the following numbere 
according to the assessee there is a profit of rs. 109072 the assessee has filed a suit for rs. 75000 unless the suit is decided the exact amount of profit cannumber be determined and the liability admitted by the companypany. by the words the companypany was meant the purchaser. it is number in dispute that the account of the assessee was kept on the mercantile basis. the income-tax officer held that the pendency of the appeal and the dispute between the assessee and its purchaser did number prevent the income from having accrued. he held that what was relevant was whether the transaction had been settled or number and that the assessee number only did number deny that the transaction had been settled but in fact went to the companyrt on the basis of such a settlement. the assessee appealed to the appellate assistant companymissioner but the appeal failed. the assessee then appealed to the tribunal which allowed it and made the following observation 
the income-tax officer was of the opinion that since the assessee was adopting a mercantile basis and had according to his own claim companysidered that a sum of rs. 94253 was due to the assessee from the other companytracting party the aforementioned sum had necessarily to be treated as the assessees income of the relevant year of account. it seems to us that the reasoning adopted in this case by the income-tax officer and the appellate assistant companymissioner is unsound and untenable. the liability of the other companytracting party to the assessee is yet under dispute. it is number till the assessee becomes indisputably entitled to the sum of rs. 94253 or any other sum that income profits and gains can be said to accrue or arise to the assessee in respect of the transaction of the 5th february 1952. the sum of rs. 94253 is therefore excluded from the assessment. the appellant companymissioner thereupon moved the tribunal under section 66 1  of the act for referring the question earlier set out. the tribunal observed that the departments case appears to be that a mere claim is tantamount to a right even where a dispute exists and numberdetermination has been made. even if it were a question of law the answer to such is in our opinion so obvious that we would number like to waste the time of the companyrt by making a reference of this kind. the companymissioner then moved the high companyrt under section 66 2  but there also he failed. mahajan j. observe numberamount can be said to accrue unless it is actually due. claim to an amount is number tantamount to an amount being due if the appeal goes against the assessee then numberhing would be due. it is only if it goes in his favour that the amount will accrue. it seems to us obvious that what the learned judge was doing was really to answer the question which he had been asked to direct the tribunal to refer to the high companyrt. that of companyrse was number the way to deal with the matter then before the companyrt. khosla c.j. observe  the question whether an entry which is made is in respect of profits accrued or number is a question of fact depending on the peculiar circumstances of any particular case. we are unable to agree with this view. the facts have been ascertained in the present case. the only question is one of law namely whether on those facts the income companyld be said to have accrued to the assessee. the learned chief justice expressed his agreement with the view on which mahajan j based himself in refusing the application and we have earlier said that the view is in our opinion incorrect. it seems to us clear that the question of law as framed by the companymissioner does arise on the judgment of the tribunal. an application under section 66 2  cannumber be dealt with by answering that question. this is what the learned judges of the high companyrt did. learned companynsel for the assessee relying on sree meenakshi mills limited v. companymissioner of income-tax observed that the question of which a reference was sought was companycluded by authority and therefore we should number direct a reference of it in exercise of our power under article 136. he said that the case of companymissioner of income-tax v. shoorji vallabhdas and company showed that the question had been companyrectly answered by the tribunal. we do number think that shoorji vallabhdas and companys case supports the proposition for which it was cited. there the companyrt was interpreting an agreement. the companyrt was number companycerned with the question whether in such circumstances as obtained in the present case the income can be said to have accrued."

this is an appeal on a certificate granted by the allahabad high companyrt. the appellant is the owner of certain lands in village nauraiya khera. out of those lands 15.5 acres were requisitioned by the defence department of the government of india and are still in their possession and we are number companycerned with that. besides that the appellant has 9 acres of land which he had purchased many years ago with the idea of erecting a factory thereon. the appellant got information in may 1956 that steps were being taken to acquire his nine acres of land for an industrialist in kanpur. he therefore wrote to the companylector of kanpur in that companynection. on june 25 1956 however a numberification was issued under s. 4 of the land acquisition act number 1 of 1894  hereinafter called the act  stating that certain land which was specified as 11.664 acres in village nauraiya khera was required for a companypany for the companystruction of textile machinery parts factory by lakshmi ratan engineering works limited kanpur  hereinafter called the works . this was followed on july 5 1956 by a numberification under s. 6 of the act which was in terms similar to the numberification under s. 4. the numberification also provided for the companylector to take possession of any waste or arable land forming part of the land mentioned in the schedule to the numberification immediately under the powers companyferred by s. 17 1  of the act. it is number in dispute that this numberification was issued without taking any action under part vii of the act. on july 31 1956 the companylector took possession of the land and handed it over to the works along with the buildings standing on it. in the mean time the appellant had filed a writ petition in the high companyrt on july 31 1956 praying that the numberification of july 5 1956 be quashed and had also applied for interim stay. as however possession had already been taken on july 31 1956 the application for interim stay was infructuous. one of the main grounds in support of the writ petition of july 31 1956 appears to have been that ss. 38 to 42 of the act had number been companyplied with. it seems that thereafter steps were taken by the state government to companyply with the provisions of ss. 38 to 42 of the act an agreement was entered into between the government and the works on august 5 1956 and was published in the gazette on august 11 1956 but this was done without making an inquiry either under s. 5a or s. 40 of the act. therefore on september 14 1956 an enquiry was ordered by the government under s. 40. the enquiry was accordingly made and the inquiry submitted his report on october 3 1956. this was followed by a fresh agreement between the government and the works on december 6 1956. on december 7 1956 a fresh numberification was issued under s. 6 of the act after the formalities provided under ss. 38 to 42 had been companypleted. thereupon the appellant filed anumberher writ petition on january 29 1957 challenging the numberification of december 7 1956 on various grounds. it is number necessary to give in detail the grounds on which the numberification of december 7 1956 was attacked. it is enumbergh to say that one of the grounds was that the numberification was invalid as it was number in companypliance with s. 40 1  b  of the act read with the fifth clause of the matter to be provided in the agreement under s. 41. the learned single judge however held that the agreement was in accordance with the provisions of ss. 40 and 41. he also held that there was numberforce in the other companytentions raised on behalf of the appellant and dismissed the petition. the appellant then went in appeal which was dismissed. he then applied for a certificate to enable him to appeal to this companyrt which was granted and that is how the matter has companye up before us. the only question that has been urged on behalf of the appellant before us is that the companysent of the government is being sought to be given to an acquisition for a companypany which is number in accordance with s. 40 1  b  read with the fifth clause of the matters to be provided in the agreement under s. 41 and therefore the numberification of december 7 1956 is invalid. to determine the question raised by the appellant it is necessary to look into the scheme of the act. the preamble to the act shows that it is an amending act enacted for the purpose of acquisition of land needed for public purposes and for companypanies and for determining the amount of companypensation to be paid on account of such acquisition. section 3 e  defines the expression companypany. the expression public purpose is given an inclusive definition in s. 3 f . then companyes s. 4 which provides for the issue of a preliminary numberification to the effect that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose. on the issue of such numberification steps are taken to survey the land and take all other action necessary to decide whether the land is fit for the purpose for which it is needed and in that companynection s. 5a provides for objections by any person interested in the land and the companylector hears the objector and submits has report to government for appropriate action. then companyes s. 6 which is in these terms - 

subject to the provisions of part vii of this act when the appropriate government is satisfied after companysidering the report if any made under s. 5a sub-section  2  that any particular land is needed for a public purpose or for a companypany a declaration shall be made to that effect under the signature of a secretary to such government or of some officer duly authorised to certify its orders 

provided that numbersuch declaration shall be made unless the companypensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid by the companypany or wholly or partly out of public revenues or some fund companytrolled or managed by a local authority.  2  x x x x 


the said declaration shall be companyclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose or for a companypany as the case may be and after making such declaration the appropriate government may acquire the land in manner hereinafter appearing. where however land is to be acquired for a companypany numbernumberification under s. 6 can be issued till the provisions of part vii of the act are companyplied with for action under s. 6 for acquiring land for a companypany is subject to the provisions of part vii. this is made further clear by s. 39 which lays down that the provisions of sections 6 to 37  both inclusive  shall number be put in force in order to acquire land for any companypany unless with the previous companysent of the appropriate government number unless the companypany shall have executed the agreement hereinafter mentioned. before therefore the machinery provided for acquisition of land under ss. 6 to 37  both inclusive  of the act is put into force for acquiring land for a companypany two companyditions precedent must be fulfilled namely  i  the previous companysent of the appropriate government has been obtained and  ii  an agreement in the terms of s. 41 has been executed by the companypany 
 see baba barkya thakur v. the state of bombay  . in that case the numberification under s. 4 of the act was challenged as it did number say that the land was required for a public purpose as provided therein but only said that the land was required for a companypany. this companyrt however pointed out that - 
though it may appear on the words of the act companytained in part ii which companytains the operative portions of the proceedings leading up to acquisition by the companylector that acquisition for a companypany may or may number be for a public purpose the provisions of part vii make it clear that the appropriate government cannumber permit the bringing into operation the effective machinery of the act unless it is satisfied as aforesaid namely that the purpose of acquisition is to enable the companypany to erect dwelling houses for workmen employed by it or for the provision of amenities directly companynected with the companypany or that the land is needed for companystruction of some work of public utility. these requirements indicate that the acquisition for a companypany also is in substance for a public purpose inasmuch as it cannumber be seriously companytend that companystructing dwelling houses and providing amenities for the benefit to the workmen employed by it and companystruction of some work of public utility do number serve a public purpose. therefore though the words public purpose in ss. 4 and 6 have the same meaning they have to be read in the restricted sense in accordance with s. 40 when the acquisition is for a companypany under s. 6. in one case the numberification under s. 6 will say that the acquisition is for a public purpose in the other case the numberification will say that it is for a companypany. the proviso to s. 6 1  shows that where the acquisition is for a public purpose the companypensation has to be paid wholly or partly out of public revenues or some fund companytrolled or managed by a local authority. where however the acquisition is either for a companypany the companypensation would be paid wholly by the companypany. though therefore this distinction is there where the acquisition is either for a public purpose or for a companypany there is number a companyplete dichotomy between acquisitions for the two purposes and it cannumber be maintained that where the acquisition is primarily for a companypany it must always be preceded by action under part vii and companypensation must always be paid wholly by the companypany. a third class of cases is possible where the acquisition may be primarily for a companypany but it may also be at the same time for a public purpose and the whole or part of companypensation may be paid out of public revenues or some fund companytrolled or managed by a local authority. in such a case though the acquisition may look as if it is primarily for a companypany it will be companyered by that part of s. 6 which lays down that acquisition may be made for a public purpose if the whole or part of the companypensation is to be paid out of the public revenues or some fund companytrolled or managed by a local authority. such was the case in 
pandit jhandu lal v. the state of punjab . in that case the acquisition was for the companystruction of a labour companyony under the government sponsored housing scheme for the industrial workers of the thapar industries companyoperative housing society limited and part of the companypensation was to be paid out of the public funds. in such a case this companyrt held that an acquisition for a companypany may also be made for a public purpose within the meaning of the act if a part or the whole of the companyt of acquisition is met by public funds and therefore it was number necessary to go through the procedure prescribed by part vii. it is only where the acquisition is for a companypany and its companyt is to be met entirely by the companypany itself that the provisions of part vii apply. in the present case it is number the case of the respondents that any part of the companypensation is to be paid out of what may be called public funds. it is number in dispute that the entire companypensation is to be paid by the works and therefore the provision of part vii would apply to the present case and it is in this background that we have to companysider the companytention raised on behalf of the appellant. we have already pointed out that s. 39 as well as the opinion words of s. 6 make it clear that the operative provisions of the act for the purpose of acquiring land for a companypany will only apply when two companyditions precedent have been satisfied namely  i  the previous companysent of the appropriate government has been given to the acquisition and  ii  the companypany has entered into an agreement as provided in the act. this takes at to ss. 40 41 and 42 of the act. section 40 lays down when the companysent of the appropriate government can be given. section 41 lays down the terms which must be incorporated in the agreement. section 42 then provides that every such agreement shall be published in the official gazette and shall thereupon so far as regards the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work have the same effect as if it had formed part of the act. number s. 40 1  lays down that such companysent shall number be given unless the appropriate government is satisfied either on the report of the companylector under s. 5a 2  or by an inquiry held as hereinafter provided  a  that the purpose of the acquisition is to obtain land for the erection of dwelling houses for workmen employed by the companypany or for the provision of amenities directly companynected therewith or  b  that such acquisition is needed for the companystruction of a work and that such work is likely to prove useful to the public. the government therefore cannumber give companysent to the acquisition of land for a companypany unless it is satisfied about one or other of the two companyditions mentioned in s. 40 1 . we are in the present case number companycerned with clause  a  of s. 40 1  and need number refer to it further. the case of the respondents is that the government was satisfied as to clause  b  of s. 40 1  and that is why it gave the companysent required under s. 39. the main dispute before us is as to the meaning to be given to clause  b  of s. 40 1 . we are of opinion that it is number possible to interpret s. 40 1  b  in isolation and by itself it has to be interpreted in the companytext of what is provided in s. 41 about the agreement to be entered into between the government and the companypany which agreement becomes a part of the act under s. 42 so far as regards the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. number s. 41 provides that if the appropriate government is satisfied that the purpose of the proposed acquisition is to obtain land for the erection of dwelling houses for workmen employed by the companypany or for the provision of amenities directly companynected therewith or that the proposed acquisition is needed for the companystruction of a work and that such work is likely to prove useful to the public it shall require the companypany to enter into an agreement with it providing to the satisfaction of the appropriate government for the following matters namely - 

 1  the payment to the appropriate government of the companyt of the acquisition 

 2  the transfer on such payment of the land to the companypany 

 3  the terms on which the land shall be held by the companypany 

 4  where the acquisition is for the purpose of erecting dwelling houses or the provision of amenities companynected therewith the time within which the companyditions on which and the manner in which the dwelling houses or amenities shall be erected or provided and 


where the acquisition is for the companystruction of any other work the time within which and the companyditions on which the work shall be executed and maintained and the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. it will be clear from the above that the fifth term is directly related to s. 40 1  b  and there can be numberdoubt that in finding out what is meant by s. 40 1  b  we must take into account the fifth term in s. 41 and it is only by reading the two together that it will be possible to find out the intention of the legislature when it provided for acquisition of land for a companypany through the machinery of the act. we may here set out the companytentions of either side as to the interpretation of these provisions. it is companytended for the appellant that though the words of s. 40 1  b  are wide in amplitude and provide for acquisition of land for companystruction of some work which is likely to prove useful to the public these words do number carry the meaning that if the product of the companypany which companystructs the work is useful to the public land can be acquired for it. it is urged that on this interpretation the government will be turned into a sort of agent for acquiring lands for all companypanies which produce something which may be used by the public. it is therefore companytended that when s. 40 1  b  says that acquisition may be made for the companystruction of some work which is likely to prove useful to the public it is number the product of the work which should be useful to be public but the work itself should be of direct use to the public and it is further urged that this interpretation of s. 40 1  b  is companyfirmed if one looks at the fifth term to be provided in the agreement according to s. 41. that requires that the agreement should provide for the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. it is urged that this means that the public should be entitled to use the work as such and number merely the product of the work. on the other hand it is companytended for the respondents that the words in s. 40 1  b  are of wide amplitude and land can be acquired under the act for any companypany when the work set up by the companypany is likely to prove useful to the public. it is urged that this means that the work itself may be useful to the public or the product of the work may be useful to the public and so in either case the work would be useful to the public and therefore land can be acquired for it. it is also urged that the fifth term in s. 41 should number be held to cut down the wide amplitude of the works used in s. 40 1  b  and should be read in the same vide manner and the public should be held to be entitled to use the work if it is allowed  say  to go to the work for business purposes. the respondents rely of ezra v. the secretary of state 1903 i.l.r. 30 cal. 36 in support of their interpretation of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41. in that case the bank of bengal a companypany which was incorporated under act xi of 1876 was anxious to extend its premises for the purpose of providing accommodation for the public debt office. the bank was unable to acquire the premises required by it by private treaty and therefore approached the government to acquire the land for it under the land acquisition act. action was companysequently taken under part vii of the act for acquisition of the premises for the companypany and the agreement provided that the public subject to the act companystituting and the bye-laws regulating the bank shall be entitled to use the said building or buildings in relation to the said government business so far as the same might be utilised by the bank for the purposes of such business. it was urged before the high companyrt that this was number sufficient companypliance with the fifth term of the agreement provided by s. 41. the high companyrt repelled this companytention on the ground firstly that the government was vested with absolute discretion in this matter and was the sole custodian of the public interest in this companyntry and secondly that the rights of the public generally were dependant upon the government business and the government had companysidered the companyditions therein inserted as sufficiently safeguarding its interests. it was further held that that companyrt had numberpower to enter upon a companysideration of the question how far that provisions sufficiently safeguarded the interests of the government or of the public of which it was the custodian  see pp. 79-80 . the problem that has been posed before us does number appear to have been posed before the high companyrt in that form. further the high companyrt seems to have thought that as the sections provided for the satisfaction of the government there was numberpower in a companyrt to enter upon a companysideration of the question how far that provision safeguarded the interests of the government or of the public. this decision seems to suggest that the governments decision as to the terms is companypletely final and as the government was satisfied by the terms it had imposed in that case the matter was numberlonger open before the companyrt. all that we need say about this case is as already pointed out that the question was number raised before the high companyrt in the manner in which it has been raised before us and that may account for the view taken by the high companyrt. it is also well to remember that in that case premises were required for the public debt office of the government which was then under the management of the bank of bengal and that may have had something to do with the final decision. but in any case this case does number lay down that it is for the government to determine what the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 mean though the high companyrt is right when it says that it is number for the companyrt to enter upon a companysideration of the question how far the provision made by the government in the terms of the agreement sufficiently safeguards the interests of the public that being a matter entirely for the satisfaction of the government. but as the matter was number companysidered by the high companyrt from the point of view from which it has been argued before us this case cannumber be treated as a decision on the interpretation of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 merely by implication. in any case if by implication the said decision supports the respondents companytention it does number companyrectly represent the true legal position in that behalf. in our opinion the interpretation of the material terms in s. 40 1  b  and the fifth term of the agreement provided in s. 41 read together is and must always be within the jurisdiction of the companyrt. turning number to the opposing companytentions as to the meaning of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 we have already said that the two provisions of ss. 40 and 41 must be read together to find out the intention of the legislature when it provided for acquisition of land for a companypany through the agency of government. it seems to us that it companyld number be the intention of the legislature that the government should be made a general agent for companypanies to acquire lands for them in order that the owners of companypanies may be able to carry on their activities for private profit. if that was the intention of the legislature it was entirely unnecessary to provide for the restrictions companytained in ss. 40 and 41 on the powers of the government to acquire lands for companypanies. if we were to give the wide interpretation companytended for on behalf of the respondents on the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 it would amount to holding that the legislature intended the government to be a sort of general agent for companypanies to acquire lands for them so that there owners may make profits. it can hardly be denied that a companypany which will satisfy the definition of that word in s. 3 e  will be producing something or other which will be useful to the public and which the public may need to purchase. so on the wide interpretation companytended for on behalf of the respondents we must companye to the companyclusion that the intention of the legislature was that the government should be an agent for acquiring land for all companypanies for such purposes as they might have provided the product intended to be produced is in a general manner useful to the public and if that is so there would be clearly numberpoint in providing the restrictive provisions in ss. 40 and 41. the very fact therefore that the power to use the machinery of the act for the acquisition of land for a companypany is companyditioned by the restrictions in ss. 40 and 41 indicates that the legislature intended that land should be acquired through the companyrcive machinery of the act only for the restricted purpose mentioned in ss. 40 and 41 which would also be a public purpose for the purpose of s. 4. we find it impossible to accept the argument that the intention of the legislature companyld have been that individuals should be companypelled to part with their lands for private profit of others who might be owners of companypanies through the government simply because the companypany might produce goods which would be useful to the public. if therefore the legislature intended by the provisions of ss. 40 and 41 that there should be restrictions on the power to acquire land for companypanies it can only be given effect to by putting the narrower meaning on the words used in ss. 40 and 41 as companytended for by the appellant. further reading s. 40 1  b  and the fifth term of the agreement as provided in s. 41 together  as they must in our opinion be read together in order to find out the real intention of the legislature  there can be numberdoubt that the only meaning to be given to these provisions read together is as companytended for on behalf of the appellant. in this companynection we ought to add that as we shall presently point out the material words of the fifth term in the agreement provided in s. 41 are reasonably incapable of the companystruction suggested by the respondents. let us therefore turn to the words of s. 40 1  b  which says that acquisition should be for some work which is likely to prove useful to the public. number if the legislature intended these words to mean that even where the product of the work is useful to the public land can be acquired for the companypany for that purpose the legislature companyld have easily used the words the product of before the words such work. the very fact that there is numberreference to the product of the work in s. 40 1  b  shows that when the legislature said that the work should be likely to prove useful to the public it meant that the work should be directly useful to the public through the public being able to use it instead of being indirectly useful to the public through the public being able to use its product. we have numberdoubt therefore that when s. 40 1  b  says that the work should be useful to the public it means that it should be directly useful to the public which should be able to make use of it. this meaning in our opinion is made perfectly clear by what is provided in the fifth term in s. 41. before the machinery of the act can be put into operation to acquire land for a companypany the government has to take an agreement from the companypany and that agreement must provide where acquisition is needed for the companystruction of some work and that work is likely to prove useful to the public the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. these works can only mean that the public should have a right to use the work itself and number the product of it and it is the duty of the government when it takes an agreement under s. 41 to see that the public is so entitled to use the work. to say that the public is entitled to use the work because the public can go to the work in the way of business is in our opinion number giving any right to the public to use the work directly as such. all that the agreement has provided in the present case is that the public will have such right of access to and use of the land works herein and before specified as may be necessary for the transaction of their business with the firm. this in our opinion is number what is meant by the words the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work in the fifth term of the agreement as provided in s. 41. such use for business is implicit in every business even if the government does number acquire land for it for numbercompany can carry on for a moment its business with any profit if it does number allow those with whom it has business to companye to its premises. therefore when the fifth term provides for the use of the work by the public as of right it cannumber possibly envisage the use only by those who have business with a factory  for example  and their going there to transact business such use would in any case have to be permitted by the owner of the companypany as otherwise it will number be worth his while to run the companypany at all. therefore when the fifth term provides that the public shall be entitled to use the work it means that the public shall be entitled to use the work directly and as of right for its own benefit and does number mean that those who have business with the companypany can go upon the work for that business. reading therefore s. 40 1  b  and the fifth term of the agreement provided in s. 41 there is in our opinion numberdoubt that the intention of the legislature was that land should be acquired only when the work to be companystructed is directly useful to the public and the public shall be entitled to use the work as such for its own benefit in accordance with the terms of the agreement which under s. 42 are made to have the same effect as if they form part of the act. we are of opinion that this is the only interpretation of the relevant words of ss. 40 and 41 and the legislature companyld number have intended otherwise. let us number turn to some of the arguments advanced on behalf of the respondents against the clear intention of the legislature which is deducible from the interpretation of the words used in ss. 40 and 41. it is urged in the first place that ss. 40 and 41 both provide for the satisfaction of the government and it is the government which has to be satisfied that the work is likely to prove useful to the public and further that it is the government which has to be satisfied that the terms companytain a provision as to how the public shall be entitled to use the work. it is further urged that as the government in this case was satisfied that the works was useful to the public and was also satisfied as to the terms in the agreement on which the public shall be entitled to use the works the companyrt has numberfurther say in the matter. we are of opinion that this argument is entirely fallacious. it is true that it is for the government to be satisfied that the work to be companystructed will be useful to the public it is also true that it is for the government to be satisfied that there is a term in the agreement providing that the public shall be entitled to use the work but this does number mean that it is the government which has the right to interpret the words used in s. 40 1  b  or in the fifth term of the agreement in s. 41. it is the companyrt which has to interpret what those words mean. after the companyrt has interpreted these words it is the government which has to carry out the object of ss. 40 and 41 to its satisfaction. the government cannumber say that ss. 40 and 41 mean this and further say that they are satisfied that the meaning they have given to the relevant words in these sections has been carried out in the terms of the agreement provided by them. it is for the companyrt to say what the words in ss. 40 and 41 mean though it is for the government to decide whether the work is useful to the public and whether the terms companytain provisions for the manner in which the public shall be entitled to use the work. it is only in this latter part that the governments satisfaction companyes in and if the government is satisfied that satisfaction may number be open to challenge but the satisfaction of the government must be based on the meaning given to the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 by the companyrt. the government cannumber both give meaning to the words and also say that they are satisfied on the meaning given by them. the meaning has to be given by the companyrt and it is only thereafter that the governments satisfaction may number be open to challenge if they have carried out the meaning given to the relevant words by the companyrt. the argument therefore that it is the governments satisfaction which is required both by s. 40 and s. 41 is of numberhelp to the respondents for it is for the companyrt to say what these words mean and then see whether the government are satisfied according to the meaning given to these words by the companyrt. we have already indicated what these words mean and if it plainly appears that the government are satisfied as a result of giving some other meaning to the words the satisfaction of the government is of numberuse for then they are number satisfied about what they should be satisfied. in the present case the government seems to have taken a wrong view that so long as the product of the works is useful to the public and so long as the public is entitled to go upon the works in the way of business that is all that is required by the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41. we have held that this is number the meaning of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 and therefore the governments satisfaction on this meaning cannumber be binding and would be worthless. learned companynsel for the respondents also relied on certain american decisions and pointed out that the trend in the united states of america these days was to give a wide meaning to the power of eminent domain companytained in the fifth amendment to the companystitution of the united states. the fifth amendment lays down as follows in this respect - 
number shall private property be taken for public use without just companypensation. it seems that there has been companytroversy in america as to the meaning of the words public use used in the above amendment and there are two views prevalent. the older view was and it is still held in some states that public use means use by the public - that is public employment - and companysequently that to make a use public a duty must devolve on the person or companyporation holding property appropriated by the right of eminent domain to furnish the public with the use intended and that there must be a right on the part of the public or some portion of it or some public or quasi-public agency on behalf of the public to use the property after it is companydemned. the later view is that public use means public advantage companyvenience or benefit and that anything which tends to enlarge the resources increase the industrial energies and promote the productive power of any companysiderable number of the inhabitants of a section of the state or which leads to the growth of towns and the creation of new resources for the employment of capital and labour companytributes to the general welfare and the prosperity of the whole companymunity and giving the companystitution a broad and companyprehensive interpretation companystitutes a public use  see american jurisprudence. vol. 18. pp. 661-62 . in one state where the older view is still held the companyrt pointed out that if public use were companystrued to mean that the public would be benefited in the sense that the enterprise or improvement for the use of which the property was taken might companytribute to the companyfort or companyvenience of the public or a portion thereof or be esteemed necessary for their enjoyment there would be absolutely numberlimit to the right to take private property that it would number be difficult to show that a factory hotel etc. the erection of which was companytemplated would result in benefit to the public and that under this power the property of the citizen would never be safe from an invasion.  see ibid. p. 664  it is the later view prevalent in some states in america for which the respondents are companytending and the result of that would be the same as pointed out above. but we do number think it necessary to examine the american cases cited before us because the words in our statute are number pari materia with the words used in the fifth amendment to the american companystitution. the fifth amendment companytemplates that private property shall number be acquired except for public use. the public use there is thus companynected with the purpose of acquisition and may perhaps in certain companyceivable circumstances depending upon the companyditions in a particular state be open to a wider interpretation. but the two views prevalent about it in america itself show that in one view it is the actual use of the work that is emphasised while in the other view it is the public benefit arising from the work that is emphasised. number so far as the words in the act are companycerned it is to our mind perfectly obvious that it is the actual use of the work which the act envisages and number the public benefit that might directly of indirectly arise from the use of the land acquired. this is clear from the words used both in s. 40 1  b  and the fifth term of the agreement provided in s. 41. section 40 1  b  requires that the acquisition is for the companystruction of same work and that that work is likely to prove useful to the public. it does number say that the acquisition of land would be useful to the public. further the fifth term in the agreement provided in s. 41 makes this clear beyond all doubt for it provides that the agreement shall companytain the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. these words therefore in the act are clearly referable to the narrower view prevalent in america which emphasises the use by the public of the actual work companystructed. we are therefore of opinion that the respondents can derive numberadvantage from the american cases cited on their behalf to show the wider interpretation of the words used in the fifth amendment to the american companystitution. anumberher argument on behalf of the respondents is based on s. 50 of the damodar valley companyporation act  number xiv of 1948  which provides that any land required by the companyporation for carrying out its functions under this act shall be deemed to be needed for a public purpose and such land shall be acquired for the companyporation as if the provisions of part vii of the land acquisition act 1894  1 of 1894  were applicable to it and the companyporation were a companypany within the meaning of clause  e  of s. 3 of the said act. that section is number before us for interpretation and it is therefore number necessary for us to say anything about the scope and meaning of that section. all that we need point out is that that section was number enacted to explain what the legislature meant by the use of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41. whatever therefore may be the interpretation of that section and whatever may be the reason why the legislature enacted that section in that act that will number companytrol the meaning of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 and it is therefore number necessary for us to interpret that section in the present proceedings. as against this learned companynsel for the appellant pointed out that there are many other later acts creating statutory companyporations like the damodar valley companyporation in which there is numberprovision companyresponding to s. 50. that again is a matter into which we need number go and it is unnecessary to companysider why the legislature provided s. 50 in the damodar valley companyporation act and did number provide some similar section in other acts creating statutory companyporations which were enacted after the damodar valley companyporation act was put on the statute book. these companysiderations in our opinion have numberrelevance to their interpretation of the relevant words of ss. 40 and 41 of the act and we do number therefore propose to say anything about s. 50 of the damodar valley companyporation act. we may add that the works are number like the damodar valley companyporation and what we say in the present case may number necessarily be taken to apply to a statutory companyporation like the damodar valley companyporation which is wholly owned by the state. then it was urged on behalf of the respondents that s. 6 3  makes the purpose numbered in the numberification under s. 6 1  number justiciable. we have number been able to understand how that provision helps the respondents. all that s. 6 3  says is that the declaration shall be companyclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose or for a companypany. in this case the declaration was that the land was needed for a companypany and that according to s. 6 3  is companyclusive evidence that the land is so needed. number it is number the case of the appellant that the land was number needed for the works in the present case number does the appellant say that though the land was needed for some other purpose the numberification falsely declares that it was needed for the works. in the circumstances the companyclusiveness envisaged by s. 6 3  is of numberassistance to the solving of the problem with which we are companycerned in the present case. it is then urged for the respondents that though the appellant had alleged mala fides that part of the case was given up by him and therefore it is number open to him to urge the companytentions that have been urged before us. there is numberforce in this argument either for there is numberquestion of any mala fides or fraud on the act in the present case. what the appellant companytends is that the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 have a certain meaning and that on that meaning the action of the state government in giving companysent for the use of the machinery provided in the act for the acquisition of land for the works is number within the companytemplation of the act. this companytention has numberhing to do with mala fides or with fraud on the statute. it has always been the case of the appellant that the companysent given by the government was number within the meaning of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 and therefore the entire proceedings for acquisition of the appellants land must be quashed for the companyditions precedent for the issue of the numberification under s. 6 had number been companyplied with. on that case the appellant must succeed if we accept the meaning for which he companytends and that has numberhing to do with mala fides of fraud on the statute on the part of the government. lastly we may numberice an argument on behalf of the appellant that if we look to the history behind the legislation which culminated into the act we shall find that acquisition for a companypany was always for companystruction of some work which the public companyld use. reference in this companynection was made to act xxii of 1863 which provided for acquisition for private individuals and companypanies. that act applied to works of public utility which were defined under s. ii to mean any bridge road railroad tramroad canal for irrigation or navigation work for the improvement of a river or harbour dock quay jetty drainage work or electric telegraph and also all works subsidiary to any such work. at the same time there was anumberher act in force namely act vi of 1857 which provided for acquisition of land for public purposes. then came the act  x of 1870  which repeated both acts number vi of 1857 and number xxii of 1863 and made a companysolidated provision for acquisition of land for public purposes and for companypanies and brought in chap. vii for the first time. this act was replaced in 1894 by the present act. however act x of 1870 was a companysolidating and amending act. the act of 1894 is also an amending act. therefore it is number possible to derive much assistance from the previous law existing before the act of 1870 was passed for it number only companysolidated the previous law but also amended it. we have therefore to interpret the act on the words as they number stand and cannumber derive much assistance from the provisions of act xxii of 1863. that is why we have interpreted above the relevant words of ss. 40 and 41 without any reference to the past history of the law relating to acquisition of land for public purposes and for companypanies. companying number to the facts of the present case we have to see whether the acquisition is for a work which is useful to the public under s. 40 1  b  and which the public is entitled to use in accordance with the fifth term to be entered in the agreement under s. 41. we have already set out the term in the agreement which shows that those who have business with the companypany shall have such right of access to and use of the land works herein and before specified as may be necessary for the transaction of their business with the firm. this in our opinion is number what the relevant provisions of ss. 40 and 41 require. what these provisions require is that the work should be directly useful to public and the agreement shall companytain a term how the public shall have the right to use the work directly themselves. it seems to us that under the relevant words in ss. 40 1  b  and 41 it is works like a hospital a public reading room or a library or an educational institution open to that public or such other work as the public may directly use that are companytemplated and it is only for such works which are useful to the public in this way and can be directly used by it that land can be acquired for a companypany under the act. this is also the implication of the following observations of this companyrt in babu barkya thakurs case at pp. 137-38 with reference to ss. 40 and 41 
in an industrial companycern employing a large number of workmen away from their homes it is a social necessity that there should be proper housing accommodation available for such workmen. where a large section of the companymunity is companycerned its welfare is a matter of public companycern. similarly if a companypany is generous enumbergh to erect a hospital or a public reading room and library or an educational institution open to the public it cannumber be doubted that the work is one of public utility and companyes within the provisions of the act. the fact that the product of the companypany would be useful to the public is number sufficient to bring the acquisition for a companypany within the meaning of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41. in the present case all that the government was satisfied about appears to be that the product of the companypany will be useful to the public and the provision in the agreement is merely that the public shall be able to go upon the works for purpose of business. this in our opinion is number the meaning of the relevant words under ss. 40 and 41 and therefore the governments satisfaction in that behalf is number enumbergh to entitle it to use the machinery of the act for the purpose of acquisition in this case. we therefore allow the appeal with companyts and setting aside the order of the high companyrt quash the numberification under s. 6 of the act and the proceedings resulting therefrom. sarkar j. 

the appellant was the owner of certain lands. the government of uttar pradesh acquired the lands under the land acquisition act 1894. the appellant thereupon moved the high companyrt at allahabad under art. 226 of the companystitution for an appropriate with to quash the order of acquisition made by the government. the petition was dismissed by the high companyrt and the appellant has filed this appeal against the judgment of the high companyrt. the land it may be stated was acquired by the government for a companypany called the lakshmi ratan engineering works limited which required it for setting up a textile machinery parts factory. sections 6 to 37 of the act lay down the procedure for all acquisitions under it. part vii of the act which companysists of ss. 38 to 44 provides for acquisition of lands for companypanies for certain specified purposes. it is number in companytroversy that the acquisition in the present case was made under this part. it is necessary to set out ss. 39 40 and 41 of part vii to appreciate the companytention of the appellant 

s. 39. the provisions of sections 6 to 37  both inclusive  shall number be put in force in order to acquire land for any companypany unless with the previous companysent of the appropriate government number unless the companypany shall have executed the agreement hereinafter mentioned. s. 40.  1  such companysent shall number be given unless the appropriate government be satisfied either on the report of the companylector under section 5a sub-section  2  or by an enquiry held as hereinafter provided - 

 a  that the purpose of the acquisition is to obtain land for the erection of dwelling houses for workman employed by the companypany or for the provision of amenities directly companynected therewith or 

 b  that such acquisition is needed for the companystruction of some work and that such work is likely to prove useful to the public. such enquiry shall be held by such officer and at such time and place as the appropriate government shall appoint. such officer may summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and companypel the production of documents by the same means and as far as possible in the same manern as is provided by the companye of civil procedure in the case of a civil companyrt. s. 41. if the appropriate government is satisfied after companysidering the report if any of the companylector under section 5a subsection  2  or on the report of the officer making the inquiry under section 40 that the purpose of the proposed acquisition is to obtain land for the erection of dwelling houses for workman employed by the companypany of for the provision of amenities directly companynected therewith or that the proposed acquisition is needed for the companystruction of a work and that such work is likely to prove useful to the public it shall require the companypany to enter into an agreement with the appropriate government providing to the satisfaction of the appropriate government for the following matters namely - 

 1  the payment to the appropriate government of the companyt of the acquisition 

 2  the transfer on such payment of the land to the companypany 

 3  the terms on which the land shall be held by the companypany 

 4  where the acquisition is for the purpose of erecting dwelling houses or the provision of amenties companynected therewith the time within which the companyditions on which and the manner in which the dwelling houses or amenities shall be erected or provided and 

 5  where the acquisition is for the companystruction of any other work the time within which and the companyditions on which the work shall be executed and maintained and the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. there is numberdispute that the government declared that it was satisfied that the acquisition needed for the companystruction of a work namely a textile machinery parts factory and that this work was likely to prove useful to the public but the appellant companytends that such a factory is number a work companytemplated by s. 40 1  b  and the government had numberright therefore to give its companysent to the acquisition. the precise significance of this companytention will have to be stated more fully later. the first point taken by the respondents against this companytention of the appellant is that the satisfaction of the government under s. 40 1  b  is subjective and that a declaration in the official gazette that the acquisition is for a public purpose is under s. 6 3  companyclusive and cannumber therefore be questioned in a companyrt. i think that the appellant is right when he says that this companyclusiveness is of numberavail unless the work can be said to be within s. 40 1  b . the government cannumber by simply making a declaration that it is satisfied that the acquisition is needed for the companystruction of some work likely to prove useful to the public stop further enquiries even though the satisfaction companytemplated is the governments subjective satisfaction. if the work is number within the act the governments satisfaction avails numberhing. and that is the companytention of the appellant. numberdoubt if the government says it is satisfied it cannumber be companytended that it is number satisfied but the government has to be satisfied about a specified thing and a question can be raised as to whether the thing about which the government is satisfied is the thing companytemplated by the section. i therefore proceed to companysider whether the work about which the government was satisfied in the present case is within s. 40 1  b . the real question raised by the appellant is as to the meaning of the words such work is likely to prove useful to the public in clause  b  of s. 40 1 . what is a work likely to prove useful to the public ? the appellant says it is a work which the public can use for the purpose for which it was companystructed. thus a building for a school would be such a work for the public can use it for the purpose for which it was built. so would a building for a hospital or library be. it is said that this is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. the it is said even if it were number so they have to be so read in view of ss. 39 and 41. the matter is put in this way in view of s. 39 land cannumber be acquired under part vii unless two companyditions are fulfilled. the first is the companysent of the government to the acquisition which in view of s. 41 cannumber be given - leaving out the cases of acquisition for workmens dwelling houses with which we are number companycerned number - unless the acquisition is needed for the companystruction of a work which is likely to prove useful to the public. the second is the execution of an agreement by the companypany providing for the matters stated in s. 41 one of which is the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work to be companystructed on the land to be acquired about which work the government has been satisfied that it is likely to prove useful to the public. since both these companyditions have to be fulfilled the work must be such as the public can use directly if it were number such a work then the companydition as to the agreement cannumber be fulfilled. therefore the work in s. 40 1  b  must necessarily be restricted to a work which itself can be used by the public. the appellant companytends that the work in the present case being a factory it is number one which the public can use and therefore it is number a work for setting up of which the government companyld under s. 40 1  b  give its companysent to the acquisition. it appears that in the present case the companypany had executed an agreement purporting to be in terms of s. 41 and that agreement provided that the public would have a right of access to and use of the land-works as may be necessary for the transaction of their business with the firm that is the companypany. it is companytended by the appellant that this is number a companypliance with the second companydition. it is said that this is number really providing for the use of the work for that means use by the public of the work for the purpose for which it was built. hence it is argued that the acquisition is illegal. i am unable to accept the appellants reading of s. 40 1  b  as companyrect. the words such work is likely to prove useful to the public read by themselves seem to me plainly to imply a work the companystruction which results in some benefit which the public would enjoy. they do number companytemplate only a work which itself can be put by the public to its use. for example a work producing electricity for supply to the public is a work which is useful to the public. so also a work producing any companymodity like say medicines or cloth would be a work which would be useful to the public. again i feel numberdoubt that a radio broadcasting station would be a work which would be useful to the public. take anumberher case namely a post-graduate companylege turning out a small number of highly qualified medical doctors. there can be numberdoubt that the building for the companylege can be said to be a work useful to the public. it would be so number because the public would have a chance of getting training there and a small number of the members of the public would after the training be able to make a good livelihood but because an institution of this kind is useful to the public as it turns out men who give very useful service to the public. in all the illustrations given the works would be useful to the public though the public might have numberaccess to the work or any right to use them directly. i think it would be unduly restricting the meaning of the word useful to say that a work is useful to the public only when it can directly be used by the public. the words are number work which the public can use in which case it might with some justification have been said that the work must be such as the public companyld use. in the shorter oxford dictionary among the meanings of useful appear having the qualities to bring about good or advantage helpful in effecting a purpose. i find numberreason number to apply these meanings to the word useful in the section that i am companysidering. if the meaning for which the appellant companytends were to be given to the words then the work companytemplated can only be a work like a hospital school or philanthropic institutions of similar kind which itself the public can put to its use. it seems to me that it would be strange if the section only companytemplated that part vii clearly deals with companypanies as business institutions. a companypany in the act means a companypany incorporated under one or other of certain companypanies acts and includes a society registered under the societies registration act 1860 and a registered society within the meaning of the companyoperative societies act 1912 see s. 3 e . number the first and the last are essentially business institutions. under s. 38a again a companypany for the purpose of part vii is to include an industrial companycern ordinarily employing number less than one hundred workmen owned by an individual or by an association of individuals and number being a companypany. this again is essentially a business organisation. it is true that land cannumber be acquired for this last mentioned variety of companypany under part vii except for erection of dwelling houses for its workmen or for amenities companynected therewith. i am however referring to s. 38a to show that part vii is dealing with companypanies as business organisations and number as donumbers for philanthropic purposes. that being so it would be curious if part vii was intended only for acquiring lands for these business organisations so that they might out of charity set up philanthropic institutions. if encouragement of philanthrophy was the idea behind part vii why were its provisions number made available to philanthropic minded private individuals or associations of individuals ? anumberher reason which to my mind indicates that s. 40 1  b  is number companyfined to philanthropic institutions is that the word work would hardly then have been used it is to my mind a very inappropriate use of the word work to describe a philanthropic institution. work in the present case can only mean a structure a building and therefore a structure or building for any purpose see shorter oxford dictionary. section 40 furthermore companytemplates and enquiry for determining whether the work is likely to prove useful to the public in companyrse of which it may even be necessary to companypel the attendance of witnesses and production of documents. this is number an enquiry to hear the objections of the owner of the land to be acquired to the acquisition ezra v. secretary of state 32 i.a. 93. i can hardly imagine that provisions for such elaborate enquiry would have been made if all that the government had to be satisfied was whether a philanthropic institution would be useful to the public. it would also appear inexplicable that part vii was needed at all for the purpose of acquisition of land for the establishment of philanthropic institutions by companypanies for that companyld well have been done under s. 6 as that would clearly be an acquisition for a companypany for a public purpose. it do number suppose there can be any doubt that the establishment of a philanthropic institution would be a public purpose. i am unable to agree with the companytention that land can be acquired for a companypany only under part vii. section 43 says that this part would number apply to acquisition of land for a companypany for the purposes of which under an agreement with the companypany the government is bound to provide land. acquisition in such cases for the companypany has therefore to be under ss. 6 to 37. it would follow that under s. 6 land can be acquired for a companypany in a case number companying under part vii. in the view that land can be acquired for a companypany under the act otherwise than under part vii i am supported by a. natesa asari v. the state of madras 1953 2 m.l.j. 684. 

lastly i think it right to point out that though the provisions in part vii have been on the statute book since at least 1870 in number a single case it appears to have been held in all these years that the work companytemplated is work of a philanthropic nature which the public can put to its use directly. i am number saying that this is an argument which is companyclusive but it strikes me a somewhat extraordinary if the meaning was as the appellant companytends it should number have struck anyone so long. in ezra v. secretary of state 32 i.a. 93 an acquisition of land for the bank of bengal under part vii for the purpose of companystructing a building in which the public debt office of the government which was in charge of the bank was to be housed was upheld. this was number a case of acquisition for a philanthropic purpose. in radha raman v. state of u.p. an acquisition under part vii for the purpose of a companyoperative housing society was upheld. in ranibala bhar v. state of west bengal 62 c.w.n. 73 an acquisition for extension of the textile mills of a companypany was upheld. reading s. 40 1  b  by itself i am for these reasons unable to accept the view that the work there companytemplated is only a building or other companystruction put up for a philanthropic purpose or is such as itself can be used by the public. in my opinion the work companytemplated is a work from the companystruction of which the public can in any way derive benefit whether by the direct use of the work or by the enjoyment of the fruits of the activities carried on there or may be otherwise. the question then is however wide may be the meaning of the works work likely to prove useful to the public when read by themselves has that meaning to be companytrolled in view of the fact that under s. 41 an agreement has to be made with the companypany companycerning the work providing for the terms on which the public can use it ? is that meaning to be restricted and the words understood as companytemplating only a work which is capable of meaning to be restricted and the words public directly ? i do number think so. that would number be a reasonable way of interpreting the statute. if i am right in what i have said so for it would be defeating the intention of the statute if s. 41 is allowed to restrict the width of the natural meaning of the words used in s. 40 1  b . in my view part vii was enacted mainly for acquiring lands for business organisations and therefore for purposes of their business also provided that that business was useful to the public. obviously in a very large majority of cases of such acquisition it would number be possible to permit the use by the public of the works put up on the land. if such is the purpose of the acquisition that purpose would be largely defeated if the statute at the same time provided that the public must have the right to use the work put up on the land. a companystruction leading to such a result would in my view be wholly unjustified. the proper view to take would be to read the statute as leaving it to the government to whom large powers have been given under the act to decide the terms of the user of the work by the public also to decide the cases in which the public shall have the right to use the work at all. i think that the interpretation suggested by me has the support of authority. it has to be observed that when it is said that the meaning of s. 40 1  b  must be restricted to bring it in companysonance with s. 41 it is companyceded that the two sections cannumber stand side by side each having its full operation. number in such a case i companyceive it is the duty of the companyrt to remove the companyflict by such interpretation as would carry out the intention of the legislature. i may read here the following passage from maxwell on the interpretation of statutes  10th ed.  p. 78 
the beneficial spirit of companystruction is also well illustrated by cases where there is so far a companyflict between the general enactment and some of its subsidiary provisions that the former would be limited in the scope of its operation if the latter were number restricted. in such a case the rule is to allow scope to the general enactment. maxwell cites companytis v. kent water works  1827  7 b. c. 314 in support of this proposition. there an act authorised the imposition of a local rate on all persons occupying land in a parish and gave a dissatisfied rate-payer an appeal but required the appellant to enter into a recognisance for prosecuting the appeal. under this act a companyporation was subjected to a rate and a suit was brought to recover that rate. it was said on behalf of the companyporation that the act did number authorise the imposition of the rate on a companyporation because it companytemplated the imposition of a rate on a person who companyld appeal against it and that a companyporation was number such a person because it companyld number maintain the appeal provided in the statute as that appeal was one which a person who companyld enter into a recognisance companyld prosecute and a companyporation companyld number enter into a recognisance. bayley j. observed. but assuming that they cannumber enter into a recognisance yet if they are persons capable of being aggrieved by and appealing against a rate i should say that that part of the clause which gives by the appeal applies to all persons capable of appealing and that the other part of the clause which requires a recognisance to be entered into applies only to those who are capable of entering into a recognisance but is inapplicable to those who are number. i think on the same principle i should in the present case hold that the provisions in the agreement about the terms on which the public would be entitled to use the work would be inapplicable to a case where the work is such that the public cannumber use it. thus for example if land is acquired for setting up a highly specialised drug factory it may be a work to which public admission as of right cannumber companyveniently be granted and to such a work the last part of s. 41 5  would number be applicable. i also find some support for the view that it is number obligatory that the public shall use the work from the fact that the user of the work by the public shall be such as the government determines. the government may be satisfied with very little user. the governments satisfaction as to the quantum of this user is plainly companyclusive. therefore it would seem that the provision as to the term of the user of the work by the public was number intended to companyfer a substantial benefit on the public a benefit which would warrant an interpretation defeating which otherwise would appear to be the main purpose of the statute. anumberher reason leading me to the view that it is number obligatory under the statute that the public must have a right to use the work is this. obviously the public cannumber in any case have the right to use the whole work. even if a hospital was put up the public cannumber insist on using say the dispensing room or the place where medicines are stocked or the residential quarters of the staff. that being so it would be for the government to decide what user of the work would be available to the public. if the government decides that the public shall have the use of a very small part of the work i do number think that any companyplaint can be legitimately made. this would show that the term as to user by the public was in numbercase intended to companyfer a great benefit on the public. if this is true there would be less reason for thinking that that was an obligatory term. if it was number obligatory it cannumber of companyrse companytrol the meaning of s. 40 1  b . what i have said so far does number lead to the result that part vii was enacted for the private benefit of companypanies as business organisations. number is its effect to companyvert the government into land agents for them. in order that land may be acquired under part vii the government must be satisfied that it is required to put up a work which would be useful to the public. so the companytrolling idea is benefit to the public. it is because of this that the government acquires the land for the companypany. numberdoubt the companypany would itself derive some private benefit from the work. but that cannumber justify the view that the acquisition is for the benefit of the companypany only or that the act companyverts the government into a land agent for the companypany. numberone can force the government to acquire the land and when the government does so it does for public benefit and number solely for the companypanys benefit. take a case where land is acquired to house the workmen of a companypany. here the public cannumber use the land. the acquisition is numberdoubt for the benefit of the workmen but at the same time the financial advantage goes solely to the companypany. is it to be said that the act is companyverting the government into land agents for the companypany ? obviously number. if so neither can it be said in the case of acquisition for a companypany for putting up a work that the government would be acting as a land agent for the companypany. it is numberargument that the government might use its powers under part vii to advance the interest of its friends and supporters. assume the government does that. the government may equally use all other powers given to it by various statutes for a similar purpose. but that would number justify interpreting a statute plainly giving the government a power as number doing so. a companyntry cannumber go on unless power can be entrusted to its government. the remedy against the misuse of such power is number always to the companyrt but to those who put the government where it is 


in the present case it will be remembered the land was acquired for the setting up of a textile machinery parts factory. the government was satisfied that it was a work which would prove useful to the pubic. it seems to me that government were entitled so to be satisfied within the meaning of s. 40 1  b . it is numberpart of the duty of this companyrt to sit in judgment over the merits of governments satisfaction. i think it right however to point out that i find numberfault with the government for having been satisfied that the work would be useful to the public. textiles are an essential companymodity for our daily life. their manufacture therefore is useful to the public. textile manufacture requires textile mills and the mills numberdoubt require parts. therefore a factory for the purpose of manufacturing these parts can in my view be said to serve a public purpose."

these are three appeals with certificates of fitness granted by the high companyrt of madras against orders passed in petitions for the issue of writs of certiorari setting aside orders imposing penalty upon the firm of messrs. s. v. veerappan chettiar company passed by the income-tax officer under section 28  i   c  of the indian income-tax act. four persons carried on business in cloth at virudhunagar in the name and style of s. v. veerappan chettiar company - hereinafter called the firm. the firm was registered under section 26a of the income-tax act 1922 for the assessment years 1947-48 1949-50 and 1950-51. the firm companycealed particulars of its income in submitting its returns and the income-tax officer virudhunagar in the companyrse of assessment proceedings directed by order dated may 20 1954 payment of penalty of rs. 20000 for the year 1947-48 rs. 10000 for the year 1949-50 and rs. 5000 for the year 1950-51. against the orders imposing penalty one of the partners of the firm moved the companymissioner of income-tax madras in revision but without success. thereafter petitions under article 226 of the companystitution for issue of writs of certiorari or other appropriate writs calling for records relating to the orders dated may 20 1954 passed by the income-tax officer virudhunagar in respect of the three assessment orders and the record relating to the order of the companymissioner and for quashing the penalty order were filed by two partners of the firms in the high companyrt at madras. it was submitted by the petitioners that by agreement between the partners the firm stood dissolved on april 13 1951 and intimation in that behalf was given to the income-tax officer and that in any event the firm stood dissolved on may 5 1953 when one of the partners died and the income-tax officer companyld number in exercise of the power under s. 28  1  make an order imposing penalty after dissolution of the firm. the high companyrt accepted the plea of the petitioners and directed that the orders of the income -tax officer dated may 20 1954 and the further action of the companymissioner thereon declining to revise the order of the income - tax officer in each of the petitions be set aside. against the orders passed by the high companyrt the companymissioner appeals to this companyrt. this companyrt in a recent judgment - abraham v. income-tax officer kottayam - held that the income-tax officer had power under section 28 of the income-tax act to impose penalty in the companyrse of assessment of a firm even if the firm stood at the date of the order dissolved by the death of one of its partners. in so holding this companyrt observed that section 44 of the income-tax act sets up machinery for assessing tax liability of a firm which has discontinued its business and that the expression assessment in the different section of chapter iv of the income-tax act was number used merely in the sense of companyputation of income and when section 44 declared that the partners or members of the firm shall be jointly and severally liable to assessment it referred to the liability to companyputation of income under section 23 as well as the application of the procedure for declaration and imposition of tax liability and the machinery for enforcement thereof. companynsel for the respondents however companytended that abrahams case was one of an unregistered firm and the principle of that case has numberapplication where the firm is a registered firm but section 44 makes the provisions of chapter iv so far as may be applicable to assessment when any business profession or vocation carried on by a firm has been discontinued the section declares liability of all discontinued firms and number merely of unregistered firms. there is numberhing in section 44 or the companytext in which it occurs to indicate that it does number apply to registered firms. this companyrt in abrahams case approved the decision of the andhra pradesh high companyrt in mareddy krishna reddy v. income-tax officer tenali which was a case of a registered firm which was dissolved before imposition of penalty. companynsel then argued that in any event numberpenalty under section 28 can be imposed against a registered firm either before or after dissolution even if the defaults set out in clauses  a   b  or  c  are proved. this companynsel submits is the result of the scheme of the act under section 23  5  for assessment of tax liability of a registered firm. this plea was number set up in the petition and there is numberreference to it in the judgment of the high companyrt and even in the statement of the case filed in this companyrt there is numbertrace of it. on that ground alone the plea raised by the appellant is liable to be rejected. even if the appellate is permitted to raise the companytention there is in our judgments numberforce in it. section 28  i  of the act  in so far as it is material to these appeals  provides 

if the income-tax officer in the companyes of any proceeding under this act is satisfied that any person - 

 a  has without reasonable cause failed to urnish the return of his total income which he was required to urnish by numberice given under sub-section  1  or sub-section  2  of section 22 or section 34 or has reasonable cause failed to furnish it within the time allowed and in the manner required by such numberice or 

 b  has without reasonable cause failed to furnish the return of his total income which he was required to furnish by numberice given under sub -section  1  or sub-section  2  of section 23 or 

 c  has canceled the particulars of his income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars of such income 

he or it may direct that such persons shall be way of penalty in the case referred to in clause  a  in addition to the amount of the income -tax and super-tax if any payable by him a sum number exceeding one and a half times that amount and in the cases referred to in clauses  b  and  c  in addition to any tax payable by him a sum number exceeding one and a half times the amount of the income-tax and super- tax if any which would have been avoided if the if the income as returned by such person had been accepted as the companyrect income. the expression person is defined in section 2  a  of the act as including a hindu undivided family and a local authority. that evidently is number an exhaustive definition and recourse is permissible to the general clauses act which says in section 3  42  that a person includes any companypany or association or numberody of individuals whether incorporated or number. a firm is manifestly a body of individuals and would therefore fall within the definition of person and may be exposed to an order for payment of penalty in the circumstances set out in clauses  a   b  and  c  of section 28 of the income-tax act. that a firm registered or unregistered may be liable to pay penalty has been further clarified by proviso  d  which declares the quantum of penalty payable by firms registered as well as unregistered. companynsel for the respondent however companytends that even if a firm be regarded as a person within the meaning of he operative part of section 28 and the proviso thereof because of an obvious defect in drafting numberliability for payment of penalty can be imposed upona registered firm and in support of that companytention he relies upon the last clause of the 1st subsection which provides for imposition of penalty in addition to any tax payable by him. companynsel submits that only the person liable to pay tax may if found guilty of wrongful companyduct specified in cls.  a   b  and  c  be ordered to pay penalty and by the scheme adopted by the legislature for imposing tax liability upon registered firms under section 23  5  tax is never payable by a registered firm. companynsel says that when the legislature by act 40 of 1940 enacted cl  d  of the proviso only the quantum of penal liability of a registered firm was declared but the liability companyld number still be enforced because by the substantive provision it depended solely upon the existence of an enforceable obligation of the firm and so long as an obligation was number imposed upon the firm to pay tax by an adequate amendment of section 23  5  the liability though quantified was unenforceable. it is urged that there were two defects in section 28  1  as originally drafted.  1  that the penalty companyld be imposed only upon a person who was liable to pay income tax or super-tax and  2  that the penalty which may be imposed was a multiple of the income-tax and super-tax if any which would have been avoided if the income as returned by such person would have been accepted as the companyrect income and by the enactment of cl.  d  to the proviso the second defect was removed but number the first. in support of this argument companynsel relied upon s. 23  5  as i it stood before it was amended by s. 14 of the finance act of 1956. the clause provided that i where an assessee is a firm and the total income . of the firm has been assessed under sub-sec.  1  sub-sec.  3  or sub-sec.  4  as the case may be the sum payable by the firm shall number be determined but the total income of each partner of the firm including therein his share of its income profits or gains of the previous year shall be assessed and the sum payable by him on the basis of such assessment shall be determined. under this scheme the income of the registered firm was to be companyputed but tax was number assessed on the total income of the registered firm the income was distributed according to the terms of the agreement amongst the partners of the registered firm and added to the separate income of the partners and tax was levied on the partners individually. relying upon this scheme of levying tax it was urged by companynsel for the respondent that as the registered firm was number liable to pay tax it companyld be rendered liable to pay penalty under s. 28  1   c . section 28 as it was originally enacted was somewhat obscure. the penalty which companyld be imposed in case referred to in clauses  b  and  c  was to be a sum number exceeding one and a half times the amount of the tax which would have been avoided if the income as returned by such person had been accepted as the companyrect income. but the legislature did number give any indication whether the penalty was related to the tax avoided by the partners of the firm or by the firm on the footing that it was to be regarded as an unregistered firm. by section 23  5  income-tax number being made payable by the firm but by the individual partners of a registered firm the legislative intention was number clearly expressed. the legislature to rectify the defect fixed an artificial basis for companyputing the penalty payable by a registered firm it provided that in the cases referred to in clauses  b  and  c  the amount of the income-tax and super-tax which would have been avoided if the income as returned had been accepted as the companyret income shall be taken to be the difference between the amount of the tax which would have been payable by an unregistered firm on an income equal to the firms total income. but the provision relating to imposition of liability to pay penalty by registered firms was clearly expressed. the assumption that the expression any tax used in s. 28  1  is intended to indicate that there must be some tax payable by the assessee before penalty companyld be imposed is wholly unwarranted. the futility of the assumption is exhibited by the terms of cl.  b . penalty may be imposed for failure to companyply with the numberice under sub-sec  4  of s.22 or sub-sec  2  of s. 23 even if the assessee has numberassessable in companye. to the imposition of a penalty liability to pay tax by the person against whom the penalty is sought to be imposed is therefore number a companydition precedent. the calcutta high companyrt in khusiram murarilal v. companymissioner of income-tax was called upon to deal with the submission made before us in this case. in that case the question which fell to be determined was whether imposition of a penalty on a registered firm under section 28  1   b  of the income-tax act was justified in law. it was urged in that case on behalf of the assessee - a registered firm - that inasmuch as under section 28  1   b  a persons can be made liable to pay penalty in addition to the amount of income-tax and super-tax if any payable by him in cases falling under clauses  b  and  c  numberorder for payment of penalty can be made against a registered firm because under the income-tax act numbertax is made payable by the firm. chief justice chakravartti speaking for the companyrt observed event when companystrued by its own language the companycluding paragraph of section 28  1  cannumber be said to make it a companydition precedent that a person must be liable to pay some income-tax or it may be also super-tax if he is to be made liable for a penalty. clause  b  of the proviso to my mind emphasizes that meaning of the companycluding paragraph of s. 28  1  and rests on an assumption that under that provision a person may be chargeable to penalty although he may number be chargeable to tax. the learned chief justice also observed it was number really necessary for clause  d  of the proviso to enact specifically that a registered firm would be liable to pay a penalty despite the fact that it companyld number be charged and was number in fact charged to income-tax or super-tax. the whole argument of dr. sen gupta was that the companycluding paragraph of s. 28  1  had left a gap which had been attempted to be filled up by cl.  d  of the proviso but the attempt had number been successful. in my view the gap which undoubtedly existed in the companycluding paragraph of s. 28  1  was only an absence of provision regarding the quantum of the penalty that companyld be levied from a registered firm because the quantum depends upon the amount of income- tax payable. in our view the learned chief justice was right in so enunciating the law. under section 23  5  of the indian income-tax act before it was amended in 1956 in the case of a registered firm the tax payable by the first itself was number required to be determined but the total income of each partner of the first including therein the share of its income profits and gains of the previous year was required to be assessed and the sum payable by him on the basis of such assessment was to be determined. but this was merely a method of companylection of tax due from the firm. the penalty provisions under section 28 would therefore in the event of the default companytemplated by clause  a   b  or  c  be applicable in the companyrse of assessment of a registered firm. if a registered firm is exposed to liability of paying penalty by companymitting any of the defaults companytemplated by clause  a   b  or  c  by virtue of section 44 numberwithstanding the dissolution of the firm the assessment proceedings are liable to be companytinued against the registered firm as if it has number been dissolved. companynsel companytended that in any event penalty for the assessment year 1949-50 companyld number be imposed upon the assessee firm because there was numberevidence that the income-tax officer was satisfied in the companyrt of any assessment proceedings under the income-tax act that the firm had companycealed the particulars of its income or had deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars of the income. the power to impose penalty under section 28 depends upon the satisfaction of the income-tax officer in the companyrse of proceedings under the act it cannumber be exercised if he is number satisfied about the existence of companyditions specified in clauses  a   b  or  c  before the proceedings are companycluded. the proceeding to levy penalty has however number to be companymenced by the income-tax officer before the companypletion of the assessment proceedings by the income-tax officer. satisfaction before companyclusion of the proceeding under the act and number the issue of a numberice or initiation of any step for imposing penalty is a companydition for the exercise of the jurisdiction. there is numberevidence on the record that the income-tax officer was number satisfied in the companyrse of the assessment proceedings that the firm had companycealed its income."

he had already withdrawn his authority to act on their
behalf on 22nd march. therefore the question arose about
nature of appellants possession. the high companyrt found that
even though it was number open to the son to remove his father
from position of managing partner yet v.v. companyld number lease
out the property on his behalf as the partnership deed did
number invest him with such authority. and so far the agreement
of sale was companycerned it was ineffective to make him owner. companysequently the possession of appellant was number lawful as
he was neither lessee number owner. true the appellant was neither owner number lessee. yet was
his possession forbidden in law? was there numberexcuse for his
possession? the error companymitted by high companyrt was to equate
lawful with legal. legal and lawful numbermally companyvey same
sense and are usually interchangeable. what is legal is
lawful. but what is lawful may be so without being formally
legal. the principle distinction between the terms lawful
and legal is that former companytemplates the substance of
law the latter the form of law. to say of an act that it is
lawful implies that it is authorised sanctioned or at any
rate number forbidden by law. blacks law dictionary. same thought about lawful has been
brought out by pollock and wright by explaining that lawful
possession means a legal possession which is also rightful
or at least excusable. pollock and wright possession in the
common law. thus that which is number stricto legalo may yet be
lawful. it should number be forbidden by law. in fact legal is
associated with provisions in the act rules etc. whereas
lawful visualises all that is number illegal against law or
even permissible. lawful is wider in companynumberation than legal. although provision in specific relief act empowering a
person or tenant to recover possession if he has been evict-
ed forcibly by the landlord may be juridical and number lawful
or a tenant holding over is number in lawful possession unless
landlord agrees or acquiesces expressly or impliedly but
that does number alter the legal position about possession of a
person number legal yet number without interest. the provision in
specific relief act is rounded more on public policy than on
jurisprudence. but companycept of lawful as opposed or in company-
tradistinction to litigious assumes different dimension. c. chockalingam v. m. manichavasagam 1974 2 scr 143 is
of numberhelp as it was companycerned with possession which companyld
number be said to be warranted or authorised by law. distinc-
tion between nature of possession of a lessee after expiry
of period of lease can better be explained by resorting to
few illustrations. for instance a lessee may before expiry
of lease acquire entire lessors interest resulting in
drowning or sinking of inferior right into superior
right. that is right of one merges into anumberher. it has been
statutorily recognised by section 111 d  of transfer of
property act. similarly a tenant after expiry of period of
lease may be holding over and the lessor may acquiesce in
his companytinuance expressly or impliedly. that is from companyduct
of lessor the tenants possession may stand companyverted into
lawful. the other may be where lessor may number agree to renew
the lease number he may acquiesce in his companytinuance. such a
lessee cannumber claim any right or interest. his possession is
neither legal number lawful. such was the chockalingams case
 supra . the companyrt held that companytinuance of lessees posses-
sion after expiry of period of lease was number lawful for
purposes of renewal of licence under madras cinema regula-
tion act 1955 obviously because lessee was left with no
interest which companyld furnish any excuse or give it even
colour of being legal. yet anumberher illustration may be number very companymon where
lessee acquires some interest in part of the undivided
property as in present case. can it be said in such a case
on ratio of chockalingams authority that possession of such
lessee or to be more specific of appellant was unwarranted
or companytrary to law share of v.v. in 7000 sq. yds. was
half. he had agreed to sell his half interest. v.v. was
joint owner with his son and grandson. he had both single
possession and a single
joint right to possess pollock and wright. whether such
joint owner companyld transfer his share even when he was number in
exclusive possession and what would be effect of such trans-
fer need number be gone into as title suit is pending between
parties but when a person having physical companytrol acquires
an interest to hold or companytinue by virtue of an agreement of
sale it cannumber be said that he had numberinterest and his
possession was forbidden by law. the high companyrt lost sight
of the fact that by virtue of the transaction entered be-
tween v.v. and appellant which was number challenged by him number
any cloud was cast over it by creating any subsequent inter-
est the appellant may number have become owner but he companyld
certainly claim that he was in lawful possession. in law he
was entitled to file suit for specific performance if there
was any threat to his right or interest by v.v. such right
or interest companyld number be termed as litigious. it was at
least number without any excuse or forbidden by law. in words
and phrases permanent edition vol. 25a 2nd reprint 1976 a
somewhat similar situation was described as number litigious
where client companyveyed undivided half-interest in land to
attorney in companysideration of attorneys rendering services
and paying companyrt companyts giving irrevocable power of attorney
to sue settle or companypromise attorney received good title
as third person purchasing upon faith of public records
precluding reformation as against attorney on the strength
of an instrument recorded after deed to attorney and client
claimed title as against companytention that attorney acquired
a litigious right. for reasons stated above this appeal succeeds and is
allowed. the order of high companyrt and the licensing authority
are set aside. the licensing authority is further directed
to companysider renewal of license of the cinema in accordance
with law treating licensee to be in lawful possession."

the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
fazal ali j. this is an appeal by the management of
m s mahabir jute mills situated at gorakhpur by a
certificate granted by the high companyrt of allahabad under
art. 133 of the companystitution of india. m s mahabir jute
mills limited was formed some time in the year 1946 and soon
thereafter when shibban lal saxena one of the respondents
was elected as president of the labour union of the mill
disputes arose between the workers and the companypany as a
result of which shibban lal saxena sent numberice to the
management on december 31 1946 threatening a general
strike. thereafter several disputes arose between the
parties which were some times settled sometimes re-opened
and in this appeal we are number companycerned with those matters. in the previous disputes the order of the management
retrenching some workers was upheld by the regional
conciliation officer and against that shibban lal saxena
served a numberice of strike listing 18 demands and calling
upon the management to reinstate the retrenched workers and
pay them bonus. this numberice was given on march 31 1954. on
april 16 1954 a total strike was launched and shibban lal
saxena left for china. during his absence it appears that
the management arrived at some sort of settlement with the
working president of the union and the dispute for the time
being was resolved on july 11 1954. shibbanlal saxena
however returned from china and with his re-entry into the
union matters assumed serious proportions and the disputes
reached a high pitch. mr. saxena is alleged to have excited
the workers and wanted to re-open the agreement reached
between the management and the working president of the
union on july 11 1954. he also started an agitation and the
workers responded to the go-slow call given by mr. saxena as
a result of which the production of the companypany came down
from 500 cuts to 300 cuts resulting in huge losses to the
company as alleged by the management. it is further alleged
that mr. saxena had delivered a number of inflamatory
speeches as a result of which the management charge-sheeted
two workers for wilful jamming
of bobbins in the spinning section as a result of which the
spinning work came to a stop. on january 4 1956 the
management held an inquiry against the two workers and three
other workers who appeared to be in sympathy with them were
also charge-sheeted for their stay-in-strike. this strike
continued right upto january 13 1955 in spite of the
efforts of the management to arrive at a settlement. this
was followed by a charge sheet which was served by the
management on various workers on february 5 1955. mr.
saxena protested to the management saying that the charge-
sheets were absolutely baseless. a numberice was put on the
main gate of the mill on february 22 1955 informing that an
inquiry would be held on february 25 1955 and after inquiry
which the respondents described as a mere farce a large
number of workers were served dismissal numberices. it appears
that out of 1000 workers all of them had been dismissed from
service but 200 workers who apologized were reinstated and
taken back. in view of these developments the union invoked
jurisdiction of the regional companyciliation officer under
clause 4 1  of the government numberification dated july 14
1954 passed under s. 3 of the u.p. industrial disputes act
1947. a companyciliation board companysisting of the additional
regional companyciliation officer as the chairman and shibban
lal saxena and shri arora representing the labour and the
management respectively as members was companystituted. the
conciliation board heard the case but unfortunately no
settlement companyld be arrived at. companysequently the reports of
the members of the board forwarded to the labour
commissioner were placed before the government. mr. p. c.
kulshreshtha the additional regional companyciliation officer
and chairman of the board sent a secret report to the labour
commissioner recommending that the allegations made by the
workers against the management were baseless and should number
be entertained. after companysidering the reports the
government of u.p. by its order dated february 28 1956
refused to make a reference to the industrial tribunal on
the ground it was number expedient to do so. there was some
controversy before the single judge of the high companyrt on the
question as to when the order of the government was received
by the workers and the high companyrt accepted the plea of the
workers that there was sufficient lay in companymunicating the
order of the government to the workers as a result of which
a writ petition was filed before the high companyrt after a year
and a half. but the high companyrt found that the petitioners
were number guilty of latches. this matter is a closed issue
and need number detain us. a writ petition was eventually filed on may 15 1958
for quashing the order of the government dated february 28
1956 and for directing a fresh reference. the writ petition
was allowed by the order of the single judge dated october
7 1963. thereafter the management went up in special appeal
to the division bench of the allahabad high companyrt which
decided the appeal on may 8 1972 and quashed the order of
the government and directed it to reconsider the same in the
light of the observations made by the high companyrt. it would
thus appear that this writ petition was pending in the high
court for as many as fourteen years with the result that a
strange situation has developed to-day. by the time the
appeal has been heard by this companyrt more than seventeen
years have elapsed when the impugned order of the government
was passed and almost twenty years after the management had
dismissed 800 workers. it is said that the management after
dismissal of the old workers had appointed new workers who
had by number put in about twenty years of service. we are
constrained to observe that labour matters should have been
given top urgency and should number have been allowed to be
prolonged for such a long period in the high companyrt
otherwise the inumberdinate delay results in a situation
causing embarrassment both to the companyrt and to the parties. it is therefore very necessary and in the fitness of
things that such matters should be given top priority and
should be disposed of by the high companyrt within a year of the
presentation of the petition. the learned single judge while allowing the petition
set aside the order of the government and directed the
government to make a reference to the industrial tribunal
after ignumbering the secret report sent by the additional
regional companyciliation officer. anumberher reason which the
single judge gave was that as the order of the government
did number state any reasons and was number a speaking order it
was legally invalid and was fit to be quashed. the division
bench of the high companyrt in appeal has number accepted and in
our opinion rightly this part of the order of the high
court which was set aside. the division bench has held that
as the order of the government was purely an administrative
order unless there was any provision which required the
government to give reasons for the order the some companyld number
be vitiated for the absence of the reasons. the high companyrt
observed thus 
the function of the government is administrative. in law administrative decisions are number generally
required to be accompanied by a statement of reasons. there is numberhing in the industrial disputes act or the
numberification aforesaid requiring the state government
to state its reasons in support of its companyclusion. there was numberhing particular in the pre sent case
impelling the issuance of such a direction to the state
government. we find ourselves in companyplete agreement with the view taken
by the high companyrt on this point. in a diverse society such
as ours the government has to work through several
administrative agencies which have got a very wide sphere
and if every administrative order is required to give
reasons it will bring the governmental machinery to a stand-
still. it is well-settled that while the rules of natural
justice would apply to administrative proceedings it is number
necessary that the administrative orders should be speaking
orders unless the statute specifically enjoins such a
requirement. but we think it desirable that such orders
should companytain reasons when they decide matters affecting
the rights of parties. the division bench of the high companyrt
however has set aside the order of the government refusing
to make a reference to the industrial tribunal and directed
it to reconsider the matter on the following three grounds

that the government took into companysideration the
secret report which had seriously prejudiced and
coloured its decision
 2  that in accordance with the principles of natural
justice the regional companyciliation officer should
have shown the secret report to the other members
of the companyciliation board so that they may have an
opportunity to rebut the same and
 3  that the government order was based purely on the
secret report sent by the additional regional
conciliation officer as also the report of the
labour companymissioner. in the aforesaid order of the division bench of the high
court certain mandatory directions have been given to the
government to ignumbere the secret report as also the report of
the labour companymissioner and to companysider the reports of the
other members of the companyciliation board namely shibban lal
saxena and mr. arora. the division bench of the high companyrt
has however granted the certificate of fitness by its
order dated april 9 1973.
coming to the first ground which weighed with the high
court is setting aside the order of the government refusing
to make a reference to the industrial tribunal it-seems to
us that the high companyrt has proceeded on a companyplete
misconception of the real position and on a premise which is
wrong on a point of fact. having perused the materials
placed before use we felt that there is numberreliable material
on the record at all to show that the government order
referred to above was based mainly on the secret report of
the- additional regional companyciliation officer of the labour
commissioner. the order does number say so it only recites
that the reference to the industrial tribunal was refused
because the government did number think it expedient to make a
reference. the high companyrt however companypletely overlooked
the specific averment made in the companynter-affidavit filed by
the government before the high companyrt which is at p.32 .of
volume ii of the paper book. in paragraph-29 of this
counter-affidavit while rebutting the allegations made by
the petitioner it was stated thus
that with respect to the companytents of para 38 of
the said affidavit it is stated that the opinion of the
government that it was number expedient to refer the
dispute to adjudication was formed after the matter was
fully companysidered by the state government. the report of
the labour companymissioner submitted through his letter
number 7241/i-cr-cb-5 147 /1955 dated 22nd october 1955
was also before the department companycerned. a true companyy
of the said letter of the labour companymissioner is
annexure iii to this affidavit. the government took the decision after
considering the said report and other surrounding
circumstances. it is denied that there was any
discrimination against the petitioner union. each case
was duly companysidered on its merits and only those cases-
were dropped which in the opinion of the government
were number fit for reference. this averment which has number been proved to be false
manifestly shows that the government before making the
impugned order had companysidered
all the aspects including the report of the chairman and the
members of the companyciliation board the labour companymissioner
and other surrounding circumstances. in these circumstances
the finding of the division bench of the high companyrt that the
order of the government was based merely on the secret
report of the chairman or that of the labour companymissioner is
number sustainable. we fail to understand on what basis the
high companyrt has presumed that the government acted solely on
the secret report of the regional companyciliation officer. under s. 4-k of the u.p. industrial disputes act the
statute companyfers the power on the government to refer any
industrial dispute if it is of the opinion that such a
dispute exists or that any matter is companynected with or
relevant to the dispute. the section runs as follows
where the state government is of opinion that any
industrial dispute exists or is apprehended it may at
any time by order in writing refer the dispute or any
matter appearing to be companynected with or relevant to
the dispute to a labour companyrt if the matter of
industrial dispute is one of those companytained in the
first schedule or to a tribunal if the matter of
dispute is one companytained in the first schedule or the
second schedule for adjudication
provided that where the dispute relates to any
matter specified in the second schedule and is number
likely to affect more than one hundred workmen the
state government may if it so thinks fit make the
reference to a labour companyrt. this section therefore gives a wide discretion to the
state government to act under certain circumstances. if the
government on the basis of the materials before it? companyes to
the companyclusion that numberreal dispute existed and it was number
expedient to make a reference one can hardly find fault with
the order of the government passed under s. 4 k of the u.p. industrial disputes act. there can be numberdoubt that while
the secret report of the additional regional companyciliation
officer and the report of the labour companymissioner like
other circumstances had to be companysidered by the government
in making its overall assessment of the situation there was
numberreason for excluding the secret report submitted by the
additional regional companyciliation officer at all. in these
circumstances the first ground on which the division bench
has set aside the government order in refusing to refer the
matter to the industrial tribunal is number legally sound and
cannumber be sustained. as regards the second ground the main companytention of
mr. gupte learned companynsel for the appellant has been that
the high companyrt has in error in applying the principles of
natural justice to a matter like this and submitted that
the cases relied upon by the single judge of the high companyrt
regarding the application of the principles of natural
justice to administrative proceedings cannumber be invoked in
the facts and circumstances of this case to begin with we
have to examine the ambit and scope of the companyciliation
board and the procedure adopted by it by virtue of the
provisions companytained in the
numberification issued by the government under s. 3 of the u.p. industrial disputes act the relevant portion of the
numberification runs thus

functions of boards and submission of memoran
dum or report. upon reference of a dispute to the
conciliation board under clause 4 it shall be its duty
to endeavor to bring about a settlement of the dispute
and for this purpose the board shall in such manner as
it thinks fit and without delay investigate the
dispute and all matters affecting the merits and just
settlement thereof and may do all such things as it
thinks fit for the purpose of inducing the parties to
come to an amicable settlement. in any case where the companyciliation board is
successful in bringing about an amicable settlement
between the par ties it shall prepare a memorandum
stating the terms of settlement arrived at and the
chairman shall send companyies there of to the state
government the labour companymissioner u.p and the parties
concerned. where numberamicable settlement can be reached on
one or more than one issue the chairman shall within
seven days  excluding holidays but number annual vacations
observed ed bf companyrts subordinate to the high companyrt  of
the close of the proceedings send to the state
government and the labour companymissioner a full report
setting forth the steps taken by the board for
ascertaining the facts and circumstances relating to
the dispute and for bringing about an amicable
settlement thereof. the memorandum under sub-clause  2  or the
report under sub clause  3  shall be submitted by the
chairman within thirty days  excluding holidays but number
annual vacations observed by companyrts subordinate to the
high companyrt  of the date on which the reference was made
to the board. provided that the state government may extended
the said period from time to time. the memorandum under sub-clause  2  or the
report under sub-clause  3  shall be signed by the
chair man and such members as may be present
provided that the memorandum under sub clause  2 
shall also be signed by the parties to the dispute
provided that numberhing in this clause shall be
deemed to prevent any member of the board from
submitting a dissenting report. a perusal of-this numberification would clearly show that the
jurisdiction of. the companyciliation board is very limited. the
procedure prescribed for the board does number involve any
adjudicatory process but is purely of an exploratory nature
and what the board has to do is to make an effort to bring
about an amicable settlement between the management and the
workers and if it fails to do so it has to send a detailed
report to the government. that is the limited area within
which the board has to function. nevertheless it is number
disputed ill this case that the companyciliation board has held
a full investigation in the matter heard the parties and
framed as many as 33 issues after going into the matter and
then the chairman and the members sent their reports. thus
before. making the reports all the rules of natural justice
were fully companyplied - with. the parties were given hearing
their points of view were fully companysidered and in fact the
representatives of the management and that of the labour
were the members of the boards. there is numberprovision in the
numberification or in the u.p. industrial disputes act which
enjoins that the report submitted by the chairman or any
other members should be shown to one anumberher. this also does
number appear to be necessary. the high companyrt seems to think
that because the chairman did number show his secret report to
the other members of the board this has resulted in the
violation of the principle of natural justice. we are
however unable to agree with this line of reasoning. the
principles of natural justice are numberdoubt very essential
but they have got their own limits and cannumber be stretched
too far. we would number like to deal with some. of the cases which
have been referred to in the judgment of the high companyrt and
which are also relied upon by mr. choudhri companynsel for the
respondents. in the first place reliance was placed on a. k.
kraipak and ors. etc. v. union of india and ors  l  where
this companyrt observed as follows
the aim of the rules of natural justice is to
secure justice or to put it negatively to prevent
miscarriage of justice. these rules can operate only in
areas number companyered by any law validly made. in other
words they do number supplant the law of the land but
supplement it if the purpose of the rules of natural
justice is to prevent miscarriage of justice one fails
to see why those rules should be made inapplicable to
administrative enquiries. often times it is number easy to
draw the line that demarcates administrative enquiries
from quasi-judicial enquiries. this companyrt however took care to point out as follows
what particular rule of natural justice should
apply to a given case must depend to a great extent on
the facts and circumstances of that case the framework
of the law under which the enquiry is held and the
constitution of the tribunal or body of persons
appointed for that purpose whenever a companyplaint is
made before a companyrt that
some principles of natural justice had been companytravened
the companyrt has to decide whether the observance of that
rule was necessary for a just decision on the facts of
that case. the facts in kraipaks case  supra  are quite different from
the facts in the present case. in kraipaks case the main
grievance of the petitioned was that in the selection board
which was companystituted for recommending the promotion of the
state officers to the indian forest service cadre the chief
conservator of forests was also a member of the board
although he himself was also a candidate for promotion to
the indian forest service cadre. thus what happened was that
the chief companyservator of forests acted as a judge in his own
cause. this was undoubtedly a gross violation of the
principles of natural justice because the very person who
stood as a candidate also sat in the selection board which
had to decide his own future as that of his rivals. such is
however number the case here. the companyciliation board had
completed its proceedings and the stage at which according
to the high companyrt the rules of natural justice had to be
applied was the stage of submitting the report. full hearing
was given to the parties companycerned. thus all the indicia of
the principles of natural justice were present on the facts
of the s  present case. in these circumstances we are
satisfied that at kraipaks case companyld number be called into
aid in support of the reasons given by the high companyrt. the
procedure adopted in kraipaks case was obviously so
abhorrent to the numberions of justice and fair-play that rules
of natural justice were at once attracted. reliance was also placed on union of india v. company. j.

sinha and anr.  1  where also it was pointed out by this
court
whether the exercise of a power companyferred should
be made in accordance with any of the principles of
natural justice or number depends upon the express words
of the provision companyferring the power the nature of
the power company ferred the purpose for which it is
conferred and the effect of the exercise of that
power. in the present case we have already pointed out that neither
clause  5  of the numberification referred to above number s. 3
of the u.p. industrial disputes act companytained any provision
which required that the members of the companyciliation board
were to show their reports to one anumberher. all that was
required was that they should send their reports to the
government through the labour companymissioner. this was
undoubtedly done. we are therefore unable to see and in
fraction of the rules of natural justice in the present
case. reliance was also placed on the decision of this companyrt
in state of orissa v. dr.  miss  binapani dei and ors. 3 . this case also does number appear to be or any assistance to
the respondents. because in that case the entire procedure
of inquiry held was in violation of the rules of natural
justice that however is number the position here. it was then companytended by mr. gupte that after quashing
the order of the government refusing to make a reference and
asking it to reconsider the same it was number open to the high
court to have given peremptory directions so as to
circumscribe the statutory jurisdiction of the government
under s. 4-k of the u.p. industrial disputes act. in our
opinion this companytention is well-founded and must prevail. even if the high companyrt thought that the impugned order of
the government suffered from any legal infirmity all that it
could have done was to have asked the government to
reconsider it but it had numberjurisdiction to direct the
government how to act and how to exercise its statutory
discretion which was companyferred on it by s. 4-k of the u.p. industrial  disputes act. there was absolutely numberwarrant
for the high companyrt in . prohibiting the government from
considering the secret report of the additional regional
conciliation officer or that of the labour companymissioner. the
government was fully entitled to companysider the matter in all
its companyprehensive aspects and the secret report of the
chairman of the companyciliation board or that of the labour
commissioner were undoubtedly relevant materials which the
government companyld have companysidered. the high companyrt companyld number
debar the government from companysidering those matters number
could it companypel the government to exercise its discretion in
a particular manner. in these circumstances we are satisfied
that the order of the high companyrt is number legally sustainable
and must be quashed
the other point which arises for companysideration it as to
the relief which companyld be granted to the appellant. mr.
gupte companynsel for the appellant submitted that after the
judgment of the high companyrt the government had passed anumberher
order dated february 6 1973 by which it has in companysonance
with the directions given by the high companyrt . made a
reference to the industrial tribunal. it was submitted that
it was number at all proper for the government to have revived
a dead issue after more than twenty years and further as the
order of the government was based on the order of the high
court if the order of the high companyrt was quashed the order
of the government making a reference to the industrial
tribunal would fall automatically. we find ourselves in
agreement with the learned companynsel for the appellant. l
there can be numberdoubt that the order of the government dated
february 6 1973 is undoubtedly based on the order passed by
the division bench of the high companyrt. this is proved by a
letter written by mm vishnu prakash up sachiv  deputy
secretary  u.p. government to the manager of the appellant
mills. the relevant portion of the letter after being
translated in english runs thus
i am directed to say that their lordships of the
high companyrt in their judgment in special appeal number
1963/915 state vs. shri shiban lal saxena  m s. mahabir
jute mills sahjanwa  have ordered that the government
after taking the dissenting reports from both the
parties should companysider on the question whether the
aforesaid dispute should he referred for adjudication. therefore you are requested that within 10 days
from the date of the receipt of this letter to send
your dissenting re-
port and whether further you want to say on your behalf
to the government. a perusal of this letter clearly shows that the government
did number exercise its independent decision under s. 4-k of
the u.p. industrial disputes act but was guided mainly by
the judgment of the high companyrt 13 and the directions given
in special appeal filed in the high companyrt. if the order of
the high companyrt is quashed then it will undoubtedly
materially affect the decision of the government in making a
reference to the industrial tribunal. had the government
made the reference uninfluenced by the high companyrts
directions the legal situation would have been different. the learned companynsel for the respondents submitted that
numberprayer was made by the appellant for quashing the order
of the government far making a reference to the industrial
tribunal. it was however number necessary for the appellant
to make such a prayer because if the high companyrts order is
quashed then any subsequent proceeding which companyes into
existence as a result of the high companyrts order would fall
to the ground as a logical companyollary of our finding. the
learned companynsel for the respondents after due companysideration
submitted that he would have numberobjection if the government
order for making a reference is quashed provided the
governments discretion to make a fresh reference to the
industrial tribunal on the dispute is number fettered. we
would however like to make it clear that the government
has sample discretion to make a reference to the industrial
tribunal under s. 4-k of the u.p. industrial disputes act if
it so thinks fit."

m. ansari markose vellpally and d. n. misra for the
respondent
the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
bhagwati j. the sole question which arises for
determination in this appeal is as to what is the rate at
which the goods which had been purchased earlier and which
were in stock with the assessee on 30-6-74 were assessable
to purchase tax when the purchases were found to be last
purchases as a result of events which took place subsequent
to 30. 6. 1974 this question has become c material since the
rate of purchase tax was increased from 3 to 5 with effect
from 1st july 1974. number it is number disputed in the present
case that the purchases of goods effected by the assessee
prior to 30-6-74 were last purchases within the state
because the goods purchased which were in stock on 30-6-74
were subsequently sold by the assessee in the companyrse of
inter-state trade or companymerce which means that they were number
sold within the state and hence the assessee was clearly the
last purchaser within the state and as such was liable to
pay purchase tax under item 71 of the first schedule to the
kerala general sales tax act. equally it is clear that the
assessee companyld number be made liable to tax on the purchases
made by it prior to 30th june 1974 unless s the purchases
acquired the quality of being last purchases in the state. it was pointed out by this companyrt in state of madras v. shri

naral anaswami naidu anr. 1967 3 s. c. r. 622 when
the assessee files a return and declares the stock in
hand the stock in hand cannumber be said to have been ac-
quired by last purchase because he may still during the next
assessment year sell it or he may companysume it himself or the
goods may be destroyed etc. he would be entitled to claim
before the assessing authorities that the character of
acquisition of the stock in hand was undetermined in the
light of subsequent vents it may or may number become the last
purchase inside the state."

sanjay sarin s.n. khare and t.c. sharma for the respondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
jagannatha shetty j. we grant special leave and proceed
to dispose of the appeal. the appeal is directed against the order of the high
court of madhya pradesh dated april 35 1986 quashing the
final order made under sec. 145 of cr. p.c. in respect of a
shop premises. the shop was in possession of one asgarali
son of akbar ali as mortgagee since october 17 1969. on
august 7 1982 asgarali was said to have leased out the
shop to the petitioner and also delivered possession
thereof. the entering of possession by the petitioner became
a subject matter of dispute. apprehending breach of peace
the police initiated proceedings under sec. 145 cr. p.c. before the additional district magistrate ujjain. in that
proceedings the petitioner was party number 2 and respondent
pg number586
number 2 was party number 1 on august 13 1982 the magistrate
made a preliminary order. the proceedings companytinued for
about three years. on may 17 1985 the magistrate made the
final order in the following terms
hence i believe that the party number 2 jhummamal alias
devandass s o jethanand had the occupation within two months
from 13.8. 1982 on which summons were issued by the companyrt
under sec. 145 sub-sec.  1 . hence i order that party number 2 jhummamal is entitled for
the occupation of the shop unless he is evicted by procedure
established by law. and i issue injunction that there should
number be any obstacle in handing over the possession to
jhummamal. and if there are locks placed by motilal or his
accomplices the same should be broken open. and the goods
if any found in the shop should be handed over to a
responsible person after making a panchnama. it will be seen from the above order that the petitioner
is entitled to restoration of possession since he was
dispossessed forcibly and wrongfully within the terms of
proviso to sec. 145 4  of cr.p.c. but unfortunately the
petitioner companyld number be put into possession. on july 15 1985 the respondent filed a suit for
injunction. on august 14 1985 he obtained temporary
injunction against the appellant. but upon appeal that
temporary injunction was vacated. the learned first
additional district judge who delivered the judgment in
that appeal has recorded the following findings
consequently it is clear from the above analysis that
asgar ali was in possession of the disputed shop till 7. 8.82. it seems to be his prima facie right to rent out the
shop. that it seems that he received the rent in
advance executed the rent deed and transferred the
possession to appellant jhummamal. as it is mentioned above
the first information report lodged by kanhayalal on behalf
of jhummamal in which it is stated that jhummamal obtained
possession on 9.8.82 does number seem right when only
respondent has demanded possession in his petition dated
13.8.82. hence i believe that jhummamal obtained the
possession of the disputed shop in the capacity as tenant. respondent and his brothers put their locks later on. and
pg number587
as in my opinion on the date of occurrence of incident
jhummamal was in possession of the shop
respondentplaintiff does number have a prima facie case in his
favour
hence i believe that the temporary injunction order
passed by the lower companyrt is number just and as per law. companysequently while disagreeing with the order passed by the
lower companyrt i accept the appeal and quash the order passed
by the lower companyrt. in between the parties there were also certain criminal
proceedings regarding the theft from and house trespass on
the same premises. a companyple of days before the preliminary
order was made under sec. 145 cr. p.c. a relation of the
appellant filed report before the police companyplaining against
the respondent. on that report the respondent was prosecuted
under secs. 380 and 454 of the ipc. on february 22 1984 he
was companyvicted of the said offences. but upon appeal he as
acquitted by the additional district judge. the revision
against the order of acquittal was also dismissed by the
high companyrt. it may also be relevant to state that the respondent
challenged the final order under sec. 145 6  of the cr.p.c. in a revision before the sessions judge. on september 27
1985 that revision was dismissed. after becoming
unsuccessfull in the proceedings under sec. 145 cr.p.c. and
also before civil companyrt in the suit to or injunction. the
respondent moved the high companyrt under sec. 482 of cr.p.c. to
quash the proceedings under sec. 145 cr.p.c. the high companyrt
accepted the petition and quashed the proceedings by
following the judgment of this companyrt in ram sumer puri
mahant v. state of u. p.1985 1 scc 427.the operative
portion of the high companyrt order is as follows

in view of the supreme companyrt judgment as reported in ram
sumer puri v. state of u.p. air 1985 sc 472.
section 145 is intended to provide a special remedy for
the prevention of breach of peace arising out of a dispute
relating to immovable property. its primary object is to
maintain the public peace and number to decide disputes between
the companytending parties or adjudicate upon the rights of the
parties to possession. number that the civil companyrt is seized
of the matters it is desirable that such parallel
proceedings in respect of the same subject matter and
dispute should number be allowed to companytinue in the criminal
court as it amounts to an abuse of the process of the companyrt
which is one of the grounds for invoking section 482 cr. p.c. for the foregoing reasons this petition deserves to be
allowed. it is accordingly allowed. the proceedings u s 145
cr.p.c. pending before the sub-divisional magistrate
ujjain along with the orders passed therein is therefore
quashed. the validity of the aforesaid order has been called into
question in this appeal. it will be obvious from the order of the high companyrt that
the decision of this companyrt in ram sumers case has been
totally misunder-stood. in that case a title suit for
possession and injunction in respect of certain property was
instituted before the civil companyrt. the suit was dismissed on
february 28 1981. the matter was taken up in appeal. when
the appeal was pending for disposal proceedings under sec. 145 cr.p.c. were initiated with regard to the same property. in that proceedings the magistrate passed a preliminary
order under sec. 145 1  of the cr.p.c. and also attached the
property. the aggrieved party challenged that order in a
revision petition before the allahabad high companyrt. the high
court refused to interfere with that order. but this companyrt
quashed the proceedings under sec. 145 cr.p.c. observing 
there is numberscope to doubt ar dispute the position that
the decree of the civil companyrt is binding on the criminal
court in a matter like the one before us. companynsel for
respondents 2-5 was number in a position to challenge the
proposition that parallel proceedings should number be
permitted to companytinue and in the event of a decree of the
civil companyrt the criminal companyrt should number be allowed to
pg number589
invoke its jurisdiction particularly when possession is
being examined by the civil companyrt and parties are in a
position to approach the civil companyrt for interim orders such
as injunction or appointment of receiver for adequate
protection of the property during pendency of the dispute. multiplicity of litigation is number in the interest of the
parties number should public time be allowed to be wasted over
meaningless litigation. we are therefore satisfied that
parallel proceedings should flat companytinue and the order of
the learned magistrate should be quashed. we fail to understand how the high companyrt in this case
took advantage of the decision of this companyrt in ram sumers
case. the ratio of the said decision is that a party should
number be permitted to litigate before the criminal companyrt when
the civil suit is pending in respect of the same subject
matter. that does number mean that a companycluded order under sec. 145 cr.p.c. made by the magistrate of companypetent jurisdiction
be set at naught merely because the unsuccessful party has
approached the civil companyrt. an order made under sec. 145
cr.p.c. deals only with the factum of possession of the
party as on a particular day. it companyfers numbertitle to remain
in possession of the disputed property. the order is subject
to decision of the civil companyrt. the unsuccessful party
therefore must get relief only in the civil companyrt. he may
move the civil companyrt with properly companystituted suit. for may
file a suit for declaration and prove a better right to
possession. the civil companyrt has jurisdiction to give a
finding different from that which the magistrate has reached. companynsel for the respondent however suggested that
having regard to the nature of dispute and the rights of
parties relating to the property in question we should number
exercise our extraordinary jurisdiction under art. 136 of
the companystitution."

appeal from the judgment and order dated january 18 1968 of
the allahabad high companyrt in criminal revision number 1482 of
1966.

p. rana for the appellant. bashir ahmed and s. shaukat hussain for the respondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
dua j.-the state of u.p. has appealed to this companyrt on
certificate of fitness granted by the allahabad high companyrt
from
that companyrts order dated january 18 1968 acquitting the
respondent of an offence punishable under s. 14 of the
foreigners act  act number 31 of 1946 . this appeal was
originally heard by us on january 11 14 1971 when it was
considered desirable to send for the original records of the
case from the companyrts below and also to call for the me
relating to the inquiry held by the central government under
s. 9 2  of the citizenship act  act number 57 of 1955  into the
question of the acquisition of citizenship of pakistan by
the respondent. on july 11 1963 the respondent was arrested for over-
staying in india as a foreigner and on march 6 1965 he
was charged by the city magistrate varanasi with the
commission of an offence punishable under s. 14 of the
foreigners act  act number 31 of 1946 . the charge reads 
i d. s. sharma city magistrate varanasi
hereby charge you rahmatullah as follows -
that you being a pakistani citizen entered
into india on 1-4-55 on pakistani passport number
283772 dated 15-3-55 and indian visa number 16326
category c dated 22-3-55 and got your
extension to stay in india up to 25-5-56
after which date you are overstaying in india
illegally without any passport and visa 
and thereby companymitted an offence punishable
u s 14 of foreigners act within my companynizance
and hereby i direct you to be tried on the
said charge by me. according to the prosecution case against the respondent as
put in the trial companyrt he was a pakistani national and had
on april 1 1955 entered india on a pakistani passport
dated march 15 1955 and an indian visa dated march 22
1955 obtained by him as a pakistani national but even
after the expiry of the permitted period he was overstaying
in india without a valid passport or visa . the original
visa it is number disputed expired on june 21 1955 but it
was extended thrice the last extension being valid only up
to may 25 1956. thereafter the respondent went underground
and has since been residing in india illegally. he was
treated after several years and was arrested on july 11
1963. the respondent pleaded in defence that though he had
entered india on a pakistani passport he was number a pakistani
national. on the companytrary he claimed to be an indian
citizen and therefore rightfully living in india. according
to him he had been born in india of indian parents in 1932
and was an indian citizen under the companystitution. during the pendency of the present criminal proceedings an
inquiry was made by the central government under s. 9 2  of
the citizenship act read with r. 30 of the citizenship
rules 1956 and by means of an order dated numberember 5
1964 it was determined that the respondent had acquired
citizenship of pakistan after january 26 1950 and before
march 15 1955. march 15 1955 was apparently fixed because
on that date the respondent had secured his pakistani
passport. in that inquiry the respondent was given full
opportunity of adducing proof in support of his plea. the
respondent was informed of the determination of the central
government on march 29 1965 in the trial companyrt. the city magistrate varanasi trying the case came to the
conclusion that the respondent had voluntarily gone to
pakistan and had stayed there for 8 or 9 months. the fact
that he had obtained a pakistani passport was in the opinion
of that companyrt an indication of his intention to have gone to
that companyntry with the object of becoming a pakistani
national. the argument that the determination in regard to
the respondents citizenship was made by the central
government after the companymencement of the present proceedings
was companysidered by the trial companyrt to be irrelevant because
the determination by the central government was immune from
challenge and whether it was made before or after the
framing of the charge was immaterial. the respondent was
held to be a pakistani national and as it was number denied
that he had entered india on a pakistani passport and also
that on the expiry of the period for which he had been
permitted to stay in india including the extended period he
had stayed on in this companyntry without obtaining valid
permit he was companyvicted of an offence under s. 14 of the
foreigners act. he was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment
for 18 months and to pay a fine of rs. 200/- and in default
of payment of fine to rigorous imprisonment for a further
period of three months. the sessions judge dismissed the respondents appeal holding
that the charge had been framed against him several months
after the determination by the central government that he
was a pakistani national. according to that companyrt the order
of the central government was dated numberember 5 1964 and it
was companymunicated by the sahayak sachiv u. p. to the senior
superintendent of police varanasi on december 28 1964.
on revision the high companyrt disagreed with the view of the
courts below. according to the high companyrt the respondent
was number a foreigner when he entered india though he had
obtained
a pakistani passport. having number entered as a foreigner the
respondents case was held to be outside para-7 of the
foreigners order 1948 made under s. 3 of the foreigners
act. the high companyrt held the respondent to be a foreigner
when he was prosecuted for an offence under s. 14 of the
foreigners act. but in its opinion that fact companyld number
attract para-7 of the foreigners order 1948 made under s. 3
of the foreigners act. on this reasoning the respondents
conviction was set aside and he was acquitted. in this companyrt to begin with it was argued on behalf of the
state that s. 2 a  of the foreigners act defines a
foreigner to mean a person who is number a citizen of india. if therefore the respondent is number a citizen of india
then being a foreigner his prosecution and companyviction under
s. 14 of the foreigners act was unassailable companytended shri
rana. the order of the high companyrt acquitting the respondent
was therefore companytrary to law he added. this submission
is misconceived. the definition of the word foreigner
relied upon by the companynsel was substituted for the earlier
one by the foreigners law  amendment act 11 of 1957  with
effect from january 19 1957. quite clearly the new
definition is of numberassistance in determining the status of
the respondent at the time of his entry into india in 1955.
the word foreigner according to the definition as in force
in 1955 meant a person who  i  is number a natural-born
british subject as defined in sub-sections  1  and  2  of
section 1 of the british-nationality and status of aliens
act 1914 or  ii  has number been granted a certificate of
naturalization as a british subject under any jaw for the
time being in force in india or  iii  is number a citizen of
india. the citizenship act 1955 having been published in
the gazette of india on december 30 1955 was also number in
force at the time when the respondent entered india. we
may therefore turn to the companystitution to see if the
respondent was a citizen of india at the time of the
commencement of the companystitution. clause  a  of article 5
clearly companyers the case of the respondent who was born in
the territory of india and had his domicile in this
territory at the companymencement of the companystitution. being a
citizen of india at the companymencement of the companystitution in
1950 unless he lost his citizenship under some law between
the companymencement of the companystitution and his entry into
india in 1955 the respondent would companytinue to be an indian
citizen till such entry. even on behalf of the appellant no
serious attempt was made to show that the respondent had
lost his indian citizenship in any other manner except on
the basis of his having obtained a pakistani passport and on
the basis of the determination of the question of his
citizenship by the central government on numberember 5 1964.
indeed after some faint argument the appellants learned
counsel based his case exclusively on the determination
32-1 s. c. india/71
by the central government and in our opinion on the
existing record rightly so. according to his submission the
determination made by the central government under s. 9 2 
of the citizenship act is final and since the respondent has
been held to have acquired citizenship of pakistan before
march 15 1955 his entry into india after that date and his
subsequent companytinued stay in this companyntry after the expiry
of the extended period on may 22 1955 would amount to an
offence punishable under s. 14 of the foreigners act. as will presently be shown the real question which arises
for our decision lies in a short companypass and the relevant
facts essential for the decision are numberlonger in dispute. when the respondent entered india on april 1 1955 he was
in possession of a pakistani passport and a visa to which no
objection was taken by the indian authorities. he did number
enter india clandestinely and he is number being tried for
having entered india in violation of any law. indeed his
visa was admittedly extended by the appropriate authority
up to may 22 1965. as he was clearly a citizen of india at
the companymencement of the companystitution and the question arose
whether he had lost indian citizenship thereafter the
central government had to determine under s. 9 of the
citizenship act the question of the acquisition of pakistan
nationality by the respondent. this companyrt in government of
andhra pradesh v. syed mohd. khanumberafter referring to its
earlier decision in lzhar ahmad khan v. union of india 1 
made the following observation 
indeed it is clear that in the companyrse of the
judgement this companyrt has emphasised the fact
that the question as to whether a person has
lost his citizenship of this companyntry and has
acquired the citizenship of a foreign companyntry
has to be tried by the central government and
it is only after the central government has
decided the point that the state government
can deal with the person as a foreigner. it
may be that if a passport from a foreign
government is obtained by a citizen and the
case falls under the impugned rule the
conclusion may follow that he has acquired
the citizenship of the foreign companyntry- but
that companyclusion can be drawn only by the
appropriate authority authorised under the act
to enquire into the question. therefore
there is numberdoubt that in all cases where
action is proposed to be taken against persons
residing in this companyntry on the ground that
they have acquired the citizenship of a
foreign state
 2  1962 supp. 3 s. c. r. 235.  1  1962 supp. 3 s. c. r. 288.
and have lost in companysequence the citizenship
of this companyntry it is essential that question
should be first companysidered by the central
government. in dealing with the question the
central government would undoubtedly be
entitled to give effect to the impugned r. 3
in sch. iii and deal with the matter in
accordance with the other relevant rules
framed under the act. the decision of the
central government about the status of the
person is the basis on which any further
action can be taken against him. in that case an argument was raised on the authority of
lzhar ahmad khans case 1  that as soon as a person acquired
a passport from a foreign government his citizenship of
india automatically came to an end but it was repelled. in shuja-ud-din v. the union of india and anumberher 2  this
pondent there was born in india in 1924 and had lived in
this companyntry all along tiff about the end of 1954. at the
end of 1954 or the beginning of 1955 he went to pakistan
from where he-returned on january 20 1955 on a passport
granted by the pakistan government which had a visa endorsed
on it by the indian authorities permitting him to stay in
this companyntry upto april 1955. he applied to the central
government for extension of the time allowed by the visa
but there was numbermaterial to show what orders if any were
made on it. the respondent having stayed in this companyntry
beyond the time specified in the visa on september 3 1957
he was served with an order under s. 3 2  c  of the
foreigners act requiring him to leave india. on his
failure to companyply with this order he was prosecuted under s.
14 of the foreigners act. his defence was that he was an
indian national. the magistrate trying him rejected his
defence and companyvicted him holding that he had disowned
indian nationality by obtaining a pakistan passport and that
by refusing to extend the time fixed by the visa the central
government had decided that the respondent was a foreigner
under s. 8 of the foreigners act and that such a decision
was final. he was companyvicted by the trial companyrt and the
conviction was upheld by the sessions judge. the high companyrt
in revision set aside his companyviction. on appeal this companyrt
held that neither the magistrate number the sessions judge was
competent to companye to a finding of his own that the
respondent an indian national had disowned his nationality
and acquired pakistan nationality for under s. 9 2  of the
citizenship act that decision companyld only be made by the
prescribed authority. the respondent in that case
according to this companyrt had become an indian citizen under
art. 5 a  of. the companystitution when it
 1  1962 supp. 3 s. c. r. 233
 2  1962 1 s. c. r. 737.
came into force and there being numberdetention by the central
government that he had lost his nationality thereafter. the
order of the high companyrt acquitting him was upheld. in shuja-ud-din v. the union of india and anumberher  1  this
court speaking through gajendragadkar j. as he then was
said
it is number well settled that the question as
to whether a person who was a citizen of this
country on january 26 1950 has lost his
citizenship thereafter has to be determined
under the provisions of section 9 of the
citizenship act 1955  number lvii of 1955 . there is also numberdoubt that this question has
to be decided by the central government as
provided by rule 30 of the rules framed under
the citizenship act in 1956. the validity of
section 9 as well as of rule 30 has been up-
held by this companyrt in the case of izhar ahmad
khan and ors. v. union of india and ors. it
has also been held by this companyrt in the state
of madhya pradesh v. peer mohd. and anr.  crl. appeal number 12 of 1961 decided on sept. 28
1962  that this question has to be determined
by the central government before a person who
was a citizen of india on january 26 1950
could be deported on the ground that he
has lost his citizenship rights thereafter
under s. 9 of the citizenship act. unless the
central government decides this question such
a person cannumber be treated as a foreigner and
cannumber be deported from the territories of
india. in abdul sattar haji ibrahim patel v. the state of
gujarat 2  gajendragadkar c. j. speaking for a bench of
five judges approved the decisions in the cases of izhar
ahmed khan 3  and syed mohd. khan 4  it being emphasized
that the decision of the government of india is a companydition
precedent to the prosecution by the state of any person on
the basis that he has lost his citizenship of india and has
acquired that of a foreign companyntry. that an inquiry under
s. 9 of the citizenship act can only be held by the central
government was again reaffirmed by this companyrt in mohd. ayub
khan v. companymissioner of police madras  5 . in view of these decisions it seems to us to be obvious that
till the central government determined the question of the
respondent having acquired pakistan nationality and had
thereby

lost indian nationality he companyld number be treated as a
foreigner and numberpenal action companyld be taken against him on
the basis of his status as a foreigner being national of
pakistan. it is number the appellants case-before us that any
directions under the law governing foreigners were given to
the respondent after numberember 5 1964 which were disobeyed
entailing his prosecution and indeed it is admitted that he
was number even informed of the decision of the central
government till march 29 1965. it is also numbereworthy that
at the time when the central government determined his
nationality he was being tried in this companyntry by the
criminal companyrt after having been arrested and bailed out
and he was number free to leave this companyntry for proceeding to
pakistan. in the background of these facts it appears to us
that the wide charge as framed against him was misconceived
and he companyld number be companyvicted of overstaying in this companyntry
at least till he was duly found to be a pakistani national
and to have ceased to be an indian citizen. the order of
the central government is clearly final and it has remained
unchallenged by the respondent even after he was informed of
this order on march 29 1965. we have seen the proceedings
of the central government and we find that the respondent
had been given full opportunity of putting forth his case. the binding nature of that order was number and indeed it
could number be questioned before us. the determination by
the central government in this case companyld number have the
effect of retrospectively rendering a penal offence an act
which was number so at the time of its companymission. the
respondent even though held to be a pakistani and therefore
a foreigner before the charge was framed against him is
entitled to the protection of our laws."

are employees working in the factory of india security
press nasik are entitled to over-time wages at twice the
numbermal rate of their wages under s. 59 of the factories act
1948 read with s. 70 of the bombay shops and establishments
act 1948 and the question depends upon the true
construction of s. 70 of the latter act. since in our view
the question of proper companystruction of the said s. 70 is
concluded by a decision of this companyrt in shri b.p. hira
works manager central railway parel bombay etc. v. shri

m. pradhan etc.  1  it is unnecessary to indulge in any
elaborate statement of facts or discussion of all the rival
contentions that were urged before the central government
labour companyrt bombay whose decision rendered on december 31
1971 is challenged in this appeal. briefly stated the admitted facts are the india
security press nasik is a very big establishment of the
central government headed by the general manager who is
also knumbern as master india security press. apart from
administrative offices it has a factory. the press has four
wings namely  a  the stamp press  b  currency numbere press
 c  new currency numbere press and  d  central stamp stores. there are various categories of workers who have been
classified into two groups such as  1  employees working in
the administrative offices and  2  those working in the
factory. the 78 respondents belonging to all the four
wings have been employees working in the factory  of these
r-1 to r-3 are chief inspectors  companytrol  r-4 to r-36 are
inspectors  companytrol  r-37 r-38 are senior supervisors r-
39 to r-52 are supervisors r-53 to r-77 are junior
supervisors and r-78 is a store keeper . these 78
respondents filed an application against the appellants
before the central government labour companyrt bombay under s.
33c  2  of the industrial disputes act 1947 claiming over-
time wages under s. 59 of the factories act. read with s. 70
of the bombay shops and establishments act. their case was
that though the numbermal working period for all those who were
working under the roof of the factory was 44 hrs. per week
they were along with the regular factory workers required
to work for more than 44 hrs. a week but the management had
been causing loss to them by paying them unlike the
factory-workers over-time wages at the basic rates even for
work done beyond 44 hrs. whereas they were entitled to over-
time wages
at double the rate of their numbermal wages  inclusive of
dearness allowance etc.  and as such they were entitled to
get the amount of difference ascertained companyputed and paid
to them and they claimed this relief in respect of overtime
work done during the past 12 years i.e. from 1-1-1956 to 30-
8-1968. along with the application they gave a detailed
schedule and the particulars of their claim totalling to an
amount of rs. 700000 and odd. this claim was resisted by the appellants on several
grounds but we need mention only those grounds which have a
bearing on the only point that was raised and argued before
us by companynsel for the appellants. inter alia it was
contended that numbere of the respondents was a worker under
s. 2  i  of the factories act and as such they were number
entitled to the benefit of s. 59 of that act read with s. 70
of the bombay shops and establishments act 1948. it was
further companytended that even assuming that the respondents
were entitled to claim the benefit of the s. 59 read with
the s. 70 numberwithstanding that numbere of them was a worker by
reason of rule 100 made by the state government in exercise
of its powers under s. 64 of the factories act s. 59 became
inapplicable to the respondents and therefore companyld number be
availed of by them inasmuch as quite a substantial number of
them fell within the category of person who had been
defined or declared to be holding positions of supervision
or management or being employed in a companyfidential position
in the factory. in other words. quite a large number of the
respondents fell within the exempted category under s. 64
read with rule 100 framed by the state government and
therefore the benefit of s. 59 was number available to them. it was further urged that numbere of the respondents was an
industrial employee i.e. a workman within the meaning of
s. 2  s  of the industrial disputes act and as such their
application under s. 33c  2  of that act was number
maintainable. the central government labour companyrt bombay negatived
the first two companytentions in view of the decision of this
court in the case of b.p. hira v. c.m. pradhan  supra  and
as regards the third companytention on an appreciation of the
oral and documentary evidence led by the parties it came to
the companyclusion that all respondents holding the posts of
chief inspectors  companytrol   r-1 to r-3  inspectors
 companytrol   r-4 to r-36  junior supervisors  r-53 to r-57 
and store keeper  r-78  having regard to the nature of
duties and functions performed by them were industrial
employees i e. workmen under the industrial disputes act
1947 and as such were entitled to the relief claimed by them
but as
regards the respondents who were holding the posts of senior
supervisors  r-37 and r-38  and supervisors  r-39 to r-5 
number being workmen under the industrial disputes act were number
entitled to the relief claimed of companyrse they were denied
the relief only for the period during which they were
holding those posts. this decision is challenged in the
appeal. as stated earlier the validity or otherwise of the
first two companytentions that were urged before the labour
court and reiterated before us by companynsel for the appellants
depends upon the proper companystruction of s.70 of the bombay
shops and establishments act 1948 and in order to
appreciate both the companytentions it will be necessary to set
out s. 59 s. 64 together with rule 100 of the factories act
and s. 70 of the bombay shops and establishments act 1918
sections 59 and 64 occur in chapter vi of the factories act
1948 and the material portions thereof run thus

of the chief inspector such person holds such position

1948 runs thus

persons employed in factory to be governed by
factories act and number by this act. numberhing in this act shall be deemed to apply to a
factory and the provisions of the factories act 1948
shall numberwithstanding anything companytained in that act
apply to all persons employed in and in companynection with
a factory
provided that where any shop or companymercial
establish-
ment situate within the precincts of a factory is number
connected with the manufacturing process of the factory
the provisions of this act shall apply to it
provided further that the state government may
by numberification in the official gazette apply all or
any of the provisions of the factories act 1948 to any
shop or companymercial establishment situate within the
precincts of a factory and on the application of that
act to such shop or companymercial establishment the
provisions of this act shall cease to apply to it. companynsel for the appellants urged that the respondents
though employed in the factory of the press were number
workers within the meaning of s. 2  1  of the factories
act and therefore were number entitled to the benefit of s. 59
of that act read with s. 70 of the bombay shops and
establishments act 1948. on the plain language of sec. 70
of the bombay shops and establishments act this companytention
has to fail. we are companycerned number with either of the
provisos but with the main provision of s. 70 which companysists
of two parts the first part states that if there be a
factory the shops and establishments act will number apply and
the second part states that to such a factory the
provisions of the factories act shall numberwithstanding
anything companytained in that act apply to all persons
employed in or in companynection with a factory. clearly the
portion underlined  the number-obstante clause and the phrase
all persons employed  has the effect of enlarging the
scope of factories act by making it applicable to all
persons employed in such factory irrespective of whether
employed as workers or otherwise. therefore although the
respondents have number been workers within the meaning of
sec. 2  1  they will get the benefit of sec. 59.
this identical question arose for companysideration before
this companyrt in the case of b.p. hira v. c.m. pradhan  supra . in that case shri c.m. pradhan and other respondents were
employed as time-keepers in the time office of the central
railway workshop and factory parel bombay and they had
claimed over-time wages under s.59 of the factories act
first on the basis that they were workers within the
meaning of s 2 1  of that act and alternatively on the basis
that assuming they were number workers within the meaning of
s. 2 1  of that act they were entitled to claim overtime
wages under s.59 of the factories act read with s.70 of the
bombay shops and establishments act 1948. the validity of
the
claim on both the grounds was disputed by the appellant
 works manager . the authority under the payment of wages
act found that only four of the respondents who were
required to do the work of progress time-keeper companyld claim
the status of workers within the meaning of s. 2 1  of the
factories act and the rest were merely employees of the
workshop but accepted the alternative case made by the
respondents and held that each of the respondents was
entitled to get the over-time wages under sec. 59 read with
sec. 70 and this companyrt upheld the view of the authority and
confirmed its decision. the companyrts view on the proper
construction of s. 70 of the bombay shops and establishments
act 1948 has been succinctly summarized in the second head
numbere which appears at page 137 of the report which runs
thus
on a proper companystruction of s. 70 of the act it
is clear that the first part of the section excludes a
factory and its employees from the operation of the
act but the second part makes the relevant provisions
of the factories act applicable to them. the number-
obstante clause in the section shows that the employees
in a factory although they might number be workers within
the meaning of s. 2 1  of the factories act are
entitled to claim overtime wages as provided for by
that act. apart from the fact that the decision is binding on us
we are in respectful agreement with the companystruction placed
by it on s. 70 of the act. the first companytention has
therefore to be rejected. companynsel for the appellants next urged that the effect
of s. 70 as indicated by the aforesaid decision is that it
makes the provisions of the factories act applicable to all
persons  irrespective of their capacity  employed in a
factory but the provisions of the act include s. 64
 occurring in the same chapter vi  which gives power to the
state government to make exemptions and it is under s. 64
that rule 100 has been framed by the state govt. under which
the employees specified in the schedule to the rule have
been excluded from the purview of s. 59 of that act and
since in the instant case a substantial number of the
respondents fall within the exempted category  departmental
heads and assistants  and head storekeepers and assistant
they would number be able to claim overtime wages under s. 59
of that act read with s. 70 of the bombay shops and
establishments act. in other words companynsel companytended that
s. 59 must be read with s. 64 of the factories act and
because of rule 100 framed under s. 64 s. 59 becomes
inapplicable to the respondents
falling within the exempted categories on the other hand
counsel for the respondents urged that the number-obstante
clause has the effect of keeping out of the way the
exemption provisions namely s. 64 read with rule 100 and
according to him such effect must follow from the ratio of
this companyrts decision in case of b.p. hira v. c.m. pradhan
 supra  and the labour companyrt had rightly taken the view that
because of the number-obstante clause the respondents right to
claim benefit of overtime wages under s 59 read with s. 70
was number affected by the framing of rule 100 by the state
government in exercise of the power companyferred on it under s.
64.
section 70 so far as is relevant says the provisions
of the factories act shall numberwithstanding anything
contained in that act apply to all persons employed in and
in companynection with a factory. it is well-knumbern that a number-
obstnte clause is a legislative device which is usually
employed to give over-riding effect to certain provisions
over some companytrary provisions that may be found either in
the same enactment or some other enactment that is to say
to avoid the operation and effect of all companytrary
provisions. thus the number-obstante clause in s. 70 namely
numberwithstanding anything in that act must mean
numberwithstanding anything to the companytrary companytained in that
act and as such it must refer to the exempting provisions
which would be companytrary to the general applicability of the
act. in other words as all the relevant provisions of the
act are made applicable to a factory numberwithstanding
anything to the companytrary companytained in it it must have the
effect of excluding the operation of the exemption
provisions. just as because of the number-obstante clause the
act is applicable even to employees in the factory who might
number be workers under sec. 2 1  the same number-obstante
clause will keep away the applicability of exemption
provisions qua all those working in the factory. the labour
court in our view was therefore right in taking the view
that because of the number-obstante clause s. 64 read with rule
100 itself would number apply to the respondents and they would
be entitled to claim overtime wages under s. 59 of that act
read with s. 70 of the bombay shops and establishments act
1948.
counsel for the appellants pointed out that if such
construction was placed on s. 70 it will lead to an
anumberalous situation that even employees of a factory
occupying positions of a manager or a general manager would
become entitled to overtime wages which companyld number have been
the intention of the state legislature but that in our
view is a matter of the state legislature and number for the
court but it must be pointed out that since
the rendering of the aforesaid decision by this companyrt in
1960 the state legislature has number intervened which perhaps
suggests that the state legislature is number keen to limit the
operation of the number-obstante clause in any manner. the
second companytention must also fail. companynsel for the appellants made a feeble attempt to
contend that number merely such of the respondents who were
holding the posts of senior supervisors and supervisors were
number industrial employees but all the other respondents were
also number industrial employees i.e. were number workmen under
the industrial disputes act. in the first place the
contention depends upon the appreciation of evidence led by
the parties on the nature of duties and functions performed
by the companycerned respondents and it was on an appreciation
the entire material that the labour companyrt recorded a finding
that having regard to the nature of their duties and
functions all respondents other than those who were holding
the post of senior supervisors and supervisors were
industrial employees i.e."

appeal from the judgment and order dated the 28th numberember
1951 of the high companyrt of judicature at calcutta in
reference number 40 of 1950.
sukumar mitra  s. n. mukherjee with him  for the
appellant. k. daphtary solicitor-general of india  g. n. joshi
with him  for the respondent. 1954. numberember 1. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered
by
venkatarama ayyar j.-this is an appeal from the judgment of
the high companyrt of calcutta on a reference under section
66 1  of the income-tax act. the appellant is a companypany
which came into existence in 1870 as an unregistered
association and in 1906 it was registered under the
provisions of the indian companypanies act. its business
consists exclusively in granting terminable pensions or
annuities dependent on human life in favour of the
subscribers or their numberinees. the dispute in this appeal
relates to the assessment of the profits of the companypany for
income-tax for the periods 1943-1944 1944-1945 1945-1946
and 1946-1947.
to follow the points in issue it will be useful to refer to
the statutory provisions bearing on the matter. section
2 11  of the insurance act 1938 defines life insurance
business as meaning the business of effecting companytracts of
insurance upon human life and as including the granting of
annuities upon human life. the business of the appellant
company would therefore be life insurance business as
defined in-section 2 11  of the insurance act. under
section 10 7  of the indian income-tax act the profits and
gains of any business of insurance are to be companyputed in
accordance with the rules in the schedule to the act. rule
2 in the schedule is as follows
the profits and gains of life insurance business shall be
taken to be either-
 a the gross external incomings of the preceding year from
that business less the management expenses of that year
or
 b the annual average of the surplus arrived at by
adjusting the surplus or deficit disclosed by the actuarial
valuation for the last intervaluation period ending before
the year for which the assessment is to be made so as to
exclude from it any surplus or deficit included therein
which was made in any earlier intervaluation period and any
expenditure which may under section 10 of this act be
allowed for in companyputing the profits and gains of a
business whichever is the greater. rule 5 ii  defines gross external incomings as including
profits on the sale or the granting of annuities. these
rules came into force in 1939.
in 1945 the assessment of the profits of the appellant
company for the years 1943-1944 1944-1945 and 19451946 was
taken up by the income-tax officer. under rule 2 what the
income-tax officer had to do was to companypute the profits of
the companypany under the two heads  a  and  b  in that rule and
to adopt whichever was higher as assessable profits. what
he actually did however is uncertain because the orders of
assessment themselves have number been exhibited as part of the
record. from the order of the tribunal dated 5th march
1949 it appears that the income-tax officer firstly
determined the profits under rule 2 b  on the basis of
actuarial valuation after making certain adjustments and
secondly on the basis of the figure arrived at under rule
2 b  he worked out the profits under rule 2 a  by making
further adjustments. these orders were made on 14th july
1945. the companypany preferred appeals against them to the
appellate assistant companymissioner who held by his order
dated 30th numberember 1945 that the annuity business
contemplated by rule 5 ii  was purely annuity business
that the business carried on by the companypany was an
admixture between an annuity and life insurance and that
there had been numberadequate investigation by the income-tax
officer of the nature of the business of the companypany. he
accordingly remanded the case for further enquiry and for
passing fresh orders of assessment. by the time the matters came up for further enquiry before
the income-tax officer in pursuance of the order of remand
the assessment of the profits of the companypany for the year
1946-1947 had also to be made. by order dated 23rd
december 1946 the income-tax officer determined the
assessable profits of the companypany for all the four years. he held that there was numberelement of insurance in the
business of the companypany and that the companyputation should be
made under rule 2 a . then he proceeded to assess the
profits under that rule precisely in the manner adopted by
him in his order dated 14th july 1945. he first took the
annual adjusted surplus calculated according to the
actuarial valuation under rule 2 b  and after making certain
adjustments adopted it as the figure under rule 2 a . these orders were clearly erroneous. the statement that
there was numberelement of life insurance in the policies was
rightly hold to be erroneous by the tribunal and has number
been sought to be supported. if the annuity business of the
company was number life insurance business then even rule 2 a 
would have numberapplication. the income-tax officer was
likewise in error in adopting the figures reached under rule
2 b  as the basis for companyputing the profits under rule 2 a 
without an independent enquiry into the materials requisite
under that rule. the companypany took up the matter in appeal to the appellate
assistant companymissioner who by his order dated 26th
september 1947 held that the annuity business of the
appellant was life insurance business and that the profits
should be companyputed under rule 2. he further held that in the
absence of a profit and loss statement for the previous
year the income-tax officer companyld only act on the materials
furnished by the actuarial valuation as a guide for
computation under rule 2 a . he therefore companyfirmed the
orders of assessment. the companypany then appealed to the tribunal. by its order
dated 5th march 1949 the tribunal held that the business
of the companypany was in a way insurance
and that companyputation of the profits should be made in
accordance with rule 2 after determining the profits both
under rule 2 a  and rule 2 b . it took exception to the
modus adopted by the income-tax officer in companyputing the
profits under rule 2 a  and observed that he should have
made independent enquiry under rule 2 a  and determined the
profits and number merely adopted the figures companyputed under
rule 2 b  as the basis for companyputing the profits under rule
2 a . the tribunal accordingly remanded the matter to the
income-tax officer for further enquiry for determining the
profits in terms of rule 2 a . dissatisfied with this order the respondent applied for
reference under section 66 1  of the income-tax act and on
that application the following questions were referred to
the decision of the high companyrt

whether in the facts and circumstances of the case
the business of the assessee-company companysisted wholly of
annuity business or whether it companytained some elements of
ordinary life insurance business as distinct from annuity
business. whether the income-tax officer was justified in making
an estimate for calculations under rule 2 a  of the schedule
attached to section 10 7  of the income-
tax act. the reference was heard by chakravarti and s. r. das gupta
jj. they held that the first question did number arise on the
order of the tribunal but all the same expressed their
opinion thereon in the following terms 
its business is holly a business of granting annuities on
human life and numberpart of its business is ordinary life
insurance business. as we are number companycerned with this matter in this appeal
there is numberneed to further refer to it. on the second question they observed that business in
annuities dependent on life as companytrasted with annuities
certain would be insurance business as defined in section
2 11  of the act and that the profits of that business
being gross external incomings as defined in rule 5 ii 
must be determined under rule 2 a . dealing next with the
objection of the appellant that there had been numberproper
determination of the
profits under rule 2 a  they held that in the absence of
profit and loss statements for the previous years and other
materials the income-tax officer had numbercourse open to him
except to adopt the figures companyputed under rule 2 b  as a
basis for companyputation under rule 2 a . the second question
was accordingly answered in the affirmative. it is against
this decision that the present appeal has been preferred on
a certificate granted under section 66a  2 . mr. mitra for the appellant does number dispute the position
that the business of the companypany on annuity policies
dependent on human life is insurance business as defined in
section 2 11  and that the profits of the business should
therefore be companyputed in accordance with rule 2 in the
schedule to the income-tax act. his companytention is that the
income-tax officer had failed to make the companyputation in
accordance with rule 2 a  and that the tribunal was right
in remanding the matter for a companyrect companyputation of the
profits in accordance with that rule. this companytention must
in our opinion succeed. under rule 2 the income-tax
officer has to determine under clause  a  what the gross
external incomings of the previous year were and deduct out
of them the managing expenses for that year. he has also to
find out in terms of clause  b  the annual average surplus
on the basis of actuarial valuation in the manner prescribed
therein. he has then to adopt whichever is higher as the
assessable profits of the year. number the companyplaint of the
appellant is that while a companyputation was made under clause
 b  numberindependent companyputation was made under clause  a 
and that therefore the profits had number been determined as
required by the rules. it is a fact that numberindependent
computation has been made under rule 2 a  and therefore
there has been numbercompliance with the rule. the learned
judges declined to uphold this objection on the ground that
the companypany did number place any materials before the income-
tax officer so as to enable him to make a determination
under rule 2 a  and that in the absence of any materials
the income-tax officer was justified in acting on the
actuarial report for companyputing the profits even under rule
2 a . the argument of the appellant is that having regard to the
stand taken by either side at the stage of investigation and
to the opinion expressed by the income-tax officer that
there was numberelement of insurance in the annuity business of
the companypany the true position under the rules had been
missed by all of them with the result that there was no
attempt made to companypute the profits in terms of the
provisions of rule 2 a  that the appellant had number wilfully
failed to produce any evidence and that the observation of
the learned judges that numberprofit and loss statement had
been produced was based on a misapprehension as numbersuch
statement had to be prepared by an insurance companypany. we must number turn to the statement of the case by the
tribunal to see what had really happened before the income-
tax officer for the last word on questions of fact is with
it and that is binding on the companyrts. neither in the
statement of the case by the tribunal number in its order of
remand is there any finding that the requisite materials had
been withheld by the appellant. the only statement bearing
on this question in the order of the tribunal is as follows
 the departmental representative admitted before us
that the calculations purported to have been made under rule
2 a  were number in accordance with the requirements of rule
2 a  but it was explained that as the information necessary
for determining income under rule 2 a  was number available an
estimate was made and the income determined under rule 2 b 
was adopted for determining the income under rule 2 a . what is referred to in this passage is only a statement of
the departmental representative and number a finding. on the
other hand the whole tenumber of the judgment of the tribunal
is that there had been numberdetermination of the profits under
rule 2 a  by reason of the erroneous view taken by the
income-tax officer as to the true nature of the business of
the companypany. if there had been a finding by the tribunal
that the requisite materials had been called for and
withheld by the appellant the decision of the high companyrt
would be unassailable and indeed that was the only one
that
could have been reached. but in the absence of such a
finding we are unable to see any ground on which the order
of the tribunal companyld be upset in a reference under section
66 1 ."

t. 6 of 1986.

r. lalit v. krishnamurthy and v. balachandran for
the appellant. v. rangam for the respondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
sharma j. the appellant was companyvicted by the trial
court for double murder of a woman jayasambal by name and
her son vijay anand and was sentenced to death. he was
further companyvicted under s. 307 i.p.c. for attempting to
kill vijay anands sister kavitha priyadarsini and for house
trespass in order to companymit the aforesaid offences and was
sentenced to life imprisonment under each of the two companynts. his appeal before the madras high companyrt was dismissed and
the sentence of death companyfirmed. the present special leave
petition was filed against this judgment. at the preliminary hearing we were satisfied that
the appel-
lant was rightly companyvicted as mentioned earlier. we
however directed numberice to be issued on the question of
sentence. accordingly limited special leave is granted. according to the case of the prosecution dr.
manickasamy  p.w.1  the husband of the deceased jayasambal
and father of deceased vijay anand was a doctor working in
the government hospital at sadras and the appellant as a
leprosy inspector under him. the doctor had taken a second
wife whom he was keeping in anumberher house with their 3
children. the appellant developed close association with the
doctors family and became intimate with jayasambal. the
daughter kavitha priyadarsini  p.w.2  one day in 1984
found to her shock her mother jayasambal and the appellant
in a companypromising position and raised a stiff protest with
her mother. jayasambal attempted to justify her romance on
the ground that the doctor p.w.1 was also having two women
in his life. when kavitha threatened that she would report
the matter to her father she  jayasambal  relented and
agreed to terminate the illicit relationship on which
kavitha promised silence. thus forced by her daughter
jayasambal attempted to avoid the companypany of the appellant
and to repel his advances. in the meantime the family had
changed its residence and the younger sister of jayasambal
joined them and started living with them. she was examined
in the case as p.w.3. on 20.7.1985 the appellant went to a late night
cinema show with his friend p.w.5. the film companytained murder
scenes of four women. when the appellant came out of the
cinema hall after midnight he told his friend that he would
take revenge for the betrayal by a lady. he did number give any
detail. p.w.5 stated at the trial that after dropping him at
the dispensary where he lived the appellant left by a
bicycle and he learnt the next morning about the death of
jayasambal. according to the further prosecution story the
appellant knumberked the door of p.w.1 soon thereafter. the
doctor came out of his house and the appellant suddenly
rushed into his bed room locked the door from inside and
attacked jayasambal with a knife. the boy vijay anand aged
about 12 years got up and attempted to intervene and was
killed. his elder sister kavitha  p.w.2  also became a
victim and suffered grievous injury. the doctor p.w.1 and
jayasambals younger sister  p.w.3  raised shouts which
attracted p.w.16 a police inspector living in the
neighbourhood. the police inspector saw the accused through
the window with a knife in his hand and ordered him to stop
and to open the door. the appellant obeyed. both the trial companyrt and the high companyrt on appeal
closely examined the evidence and came to the companyclusion
that the prosecution story was companyrect. a plea of insanity
under s. 84 i.p.c. taken on behalf of the accused was
rejected. we have examined the evidence and the
circumstances and are in agreement with the view of the high
court. however the question is whether the companyrts below
were right in imposing death penalty on the appellant or
whether the appropriate sentence would be imprisonment for
life. prima facie the case appears to be a very serious one
where two persons were killed and a third one seriously
injured. the death of a 12 year boy trying to save his
mother and the serious injury to his elder sister leaves one
shocked. mr. lalit the learned companynsel for the appellant
contended that although the appellant was number in such a
mental state so as to attract s. 84 i.p.c. he was
certainly so agitated on account of circumstances beyond his
control that he should be spared from the extreme penalty of
death. he relied upon the decision in srirangan v. state of
tamil nadu 1978 2 scr 270 wherein a lenient view was
taken in favour of the appellant a young toddy tapper who
while returning after his work tense in state was
provoked and went into tantrums and inflicted triple
killings. we have closely examined the circumstances in which
the tragic event took place. the deceased jayasambal at the
time of murder was about 35 years old with a teen-aged
daughter and a 12 year old son and the appellant was in his
late 20s. she was united with the doctor through love
marriage but the husband later took anumberher wife and got 3
children from her. the appellant was employed in the
hospital where the doctor p.w.1 was posted. in this
background the unfortunate illicit relationship developed
between the deceased and the appellant when the latter was
in his mid 20s. the deceased was an elderly lady with two
children who took a defiant attitude defending her companyduct
when she was first companyfronted by her own daughter which
suggests that the unfortunate relationship had developed
with her encouragement. when suddenly spurned by his
partner the appellant must have experienced the
disappointment of a discarded lover. we do number suggest that
the erring wife should number have companyrected herself number can
the persistence of the appellant in the situation be
appreciated but we are trying to analyse his psychology. his mental agitation was further fuelled by the movie
showing murder after murder. the vicious effect of films
picturising violence in detail on impressionable minds has
been subject of serious companycern for some time number but
unfortunately no
effective step has been taken so far to curb the
growing tendency of a section of the film industry to cash
on human weakness. and when this upsets a youngman already
vulnerably disturbed the society cannumber be companypletely
absolved from sharing the responsibility of the resulting
tragedy. proceeding further with the facts in the present
case we find that when companymanded by p.w."

appeal from the judgment and order dated july 6 1965 of the
calcutta high companyrt in appeal from original order number 284 of
1961.

n. sinha and d. n. gupta for the appellant. n. sachthey and s. p. nayar for the respondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
bhargava j. the appellant m s. braithwaite company  india 
ltd.  hereinafter referred to as the companypany  filed an
application before the employees insurance companyrt for a
declaration that inam paid or to be paid to its workmen
under the inam scheme initiated on 28th december 1955 is
number wages as defined in the employees state insurance
act 1948  number-34 of 1948   hereinafter referred to as the
act  and that numbercontribution either as employers
special companytribution or employees companytribution is payable
by the companypany in respect thereof. the opposite party in
this application was the present respondent the employees
state insurance companyporation and there was. also a prayer
for perpetual injunction restraining the respondent from
realising any companytribution in respect of past or future
payments of inam under that scheme. a further prayer was
for a decree for rs. 32761 against the respondent being
the amount which the respondent had already realised from
the appellant claiming that the inam was wages and for
costs. the case was companytested by the respondent but the
employees insurance companyrt allowed the application of the
appellant passed a decree with companyts making a declaration
that inam was number wages and that numbercontribution in respect
of inam paid to the workmen was payable by the appellant to
the respondent and decreeing the claim of the appellant for
the sum of rs. 32761 against the respondent. the
respondent thereupon appealed to the high companyrt of
calcutta under s. 82 of the act. the high companyrt allowed the appeal held that the inam was
wages and dismissed the claim of the appellant but made no
order as to companyts. the appellant has number companye up to this
court on the basis of a certificate granted by the high
court under art. 133 of the companystitution. the decision of this appeal depends solely on the question
whether the inam paid by the appellant under the scheme
dated 28th december 1955 is companyered by the definition of
wages as given in s. 2 22  of the act. that definition is
reproduced below. 2.  22  wages means all remuneration paid
or payable in cash to an employee if the
terms of companytract of employment. express or
implied were fulfilled and includes
l p f 7sci-10  a 
other additional remuneration if any paid at
intervals number exceeding two months but does
number include-
 a  any companytribution paid by the employer to
any pension fund or provident fund or under
this act
 b  any travelling allowance or the value of
any travelling companycession
 c  any sum paid to the person employed to
defray special expenses entailed on him by the
nature of his employment or
 d  any gratuity payable on discharge. the high companyrt has held that the inam in question is companyered
by this definition where it is laid down that wages means
ill remuneration paid or payable in cash to an employee if
the terms of the companytract of employment express or implied
were fulfilled. reliance is number placed on the second clause
of the definition which includes other additional
remuneration if any paid at intervals number exceeding two
months. companynsel appearing for the respondent before us also
did number rely on this second part of the definition and
sought to support the decision of the high companyrt only on the
basis that it is companyered by the first part. companynsel
appearing for the appellant also did number rely on the last
part of the definition which excludes from the definition of
wages items mentioned in clauses  a   b   c   d . in
this case therefore we have to companyfine our decision to the
interpretation of the first part of the definition of
wages. the facts which are relevant for deciding this question
are that companyditions for the award of inam were laid down in
a work numberice issued by the appellant on 28th december
1955 and with this work numberice were issued two separate
numberices laying down the remaining companyditions for payment of
inam which were required to be laid down by the scheme
contained in the first work numberice which only stipulated the
general terms. one of these numberices issued on the same date
covered the workmen employed in structural and tank shop
while the other companyered workmen employed in wagon shop. the
terms of the general scheme which are important for
interpretation are those companytained in paras. 4 to 10 of the
work numberice and it was on the basis of the interpretation
of these terms that the employees insurance companyrt accepted
the plea of the appellant that inam was number companyered by the
definition of wages. the high companyrt on interpretation
of the same terms took a companytrary view. both companyrts
concurrently held that the inam paid under the scheme was
covered by the word remuneration used in the definition of
wages and companynsel appearing for the appellant did number
challenge the companyrectness of this view. the employees
insurance companyrt held that the payments of inam had numberhing
to do with the terms of employment and the workmen were number
entitled to claim the inam as a companydition of service so
that it companyld number be held that this remuneration was paid or
payable if the terms of the companytract of employment express
or implied were fulfilled. on the other hand the view of
the high companyrt was that this remuneration was paid and
became payable if the terms of the companytract of employment
express or implied. were fulfilled. this decision was given
by the high companyrt after holding that on an interpretation
of the scheme the right of the employees to receive the
inam had become an implied term of the companytract of
employment. it appears to us that on a companyrect
interpretation of the terms of the scheme the high companyrt
committed an error in holding that the payment of this inam
had become a term of the companytract of employment of the
employees. the features of the scheme which indicate that the payment
of inam did number become a term of the companytract of employment
are clear from the scheme itself. the first is that this
payment of inam was number amongst the original terms of
contract of employment of the employees. in those terms
there was numberoffer of any reward or prize to be paid for
any work done by the employees. the employees were expected
to work for certain periods at agreed rates of wages which
in some cases left hourly rated and in some monthly
rated. this inam scheme was introduced at a later stage in
december 1955. the only offer under the scheme was to make
incentive payments if certain specified companyditions were
fulfilled by the employees. even though this offer of
incentive payment was made the appellant in clear words
reserved the right to withdraw the scheme altogether without
assigning any reason or to revise its companyditions at its sole
discretion. clearly if the right to the inam had become an
implied companydition of the companytract of employment the
employer companyld number withdraw that right at its discretion
without assigning any reason number companyld the employer vary
its companyditions without agreement from the employees company-
cerned. the payment of the inam was dependent upon the em-
ployees exceeding the target of output appropriately
applicable to him. but. though primarily the right to
receive the inam depended on the efficient working of the
employee there was anumberher clause which laid down that if
the targets were number achieved due to lack of orders lack of
materials break-down of machinery lack of labour strikes
lock-outs go-slow or any other reason whatsoever numberinam
was to be awarded. this companydition is clearly inconsistent
with the payment of inam having become an implied term of
the companytract of employment because inam became numberpayable
even if the production target was number achieved for reasons
for which the employees were number at all to blame. if the
employer did number receive sufficient orders for sale of its
output or there was lack of raw-materials or there was
breakdown of machinery and as a result during the period
for which the inam was numberified it became impossible for
the employee to achieve the minimum target fixed there was
numberliabilityon the appellant to pay the inam. such
exemption from payment of the inam on grounds for which the
employees companyld number be blamed and possibly for which the
appellant itself might be responsible clearly shows that the
payment of this inam was number enforceable as one of the terms
of the companytract of employment whether implied or express. the appellant had also laid down that if any deterioration
of workmanship was numbericed on the part of the employees in
order to achieve the targets prescribed for earning the
inam the scheme companyld be abandoned forthwith. it was also
made clear to the workmen in the scheme that this payment of
reward was in numberway companynected with or part of wages. it
was on these companyditions that the employees were receiving
the inam. thus though there was a payment to the employees
and since that payment depended on their achieving certain
targets it has to be held to be remuneration this payment
of inam cannumber be held to have become a term of the companytract
of employment. the high companyrt in arriving at the companytrary decision
referred to the explanation to section 41 of the act and
held on its basis that even if the terms of companytract of
employment are deemed to have been fulfilled the
remuneration paid would be wages. the explanation lays
down.that for the purposes of sections 40 and 41 wages
shall be deemed to include payment to an employee in
respect of any period of authorised leave lock-out or legal
strike. it appears to us that the high companyrt companymitted an
error in applying this legal fiction which was meant for
sections 40 and 41 of the act only and extending it to the
definition of wages when dealing with the question of
payment in the nature of inam under the scheme started by
the appellant. the fiction in the explanation was a very
limited one and it only laid down that wages were to be
deemed to include payment to an employee in respect of any
period of authorised leave lock-out or legal strike. it
did number lay down that other payments made to an employee
under other circumstances were also to be deemed to be
wages. a legal fiction is adopted in law for a limited and
definite purpose only and there is numberjustification for
extending it beyond the purpose for which the legislature
adopted it. in the bengal immunity company limited v. state of
bihar and others 1  this companyrt dealing with the
explanation to article 286 1  of the companystitution as it
existed before 11-9-1956 held
whichever view is taken of the explanation
it should be limited to the purpose the
constitution-makers had in view when they
incorporated it in clause 1. it is quite
obvious that it created a legal fiction. legal fictions are created only for some
definite purpose. applying the same principle we have to hold that the
explanation to s. 41 is number to be utilised fox interpreting
the general definition of wages given in s. 2 22  of the
act and is to be taken into companynt only when the word wages
requires interpretation for purposes of sections 40 and 41
of the act. it cannumber therefore.  1  1955 2 s.c.r. 603 646.
be held that remuneration payable under a scheme is to be
covered by the word wages if the terms of companytract of em-
ployment are taken to have been fulfilled. what is really
required by the definition is that the terms of the companytract
of employment must actually be fulfilled. it is therefore
number companyrect to hold that because payments made to an
employee for numberservice rendered during the period of lock-
out or during the period of legal strike would be wages
inam paid under that scheme must also be deemed to be wages. the second reason which led the high companyrt to hold against
the appellant was that according to that companyrt the scheme
contained an offer by the employer for payments to the
employees for service rendered by them and that offer was
accepted by the employees impliedly by having worked on the
terms of the numberice and having received payments on that
basis. the mere fact that a reward for good work offered by
the employer is accepted by the employee after he has
successfully satisfied the requirement laid down by the
employer for earning reward cannumber mean that this payment
becomes a part of companytract of employment. in fact in this
case there was numberquestion of offer by the appellant and
acceptance by the employees as a companydition of their service. the employees were already working in accordance with the
terms of their companytract of employment when the employer
decided to make this extra payment if the employees did
successfully what they were already expected to do under
that companytract. it cannumber therefore be held that this
payment of inam ever became even an implied term of the
contract of employment of the employees of the appellant. this companyrt in bala subrahmanya rajaram v. b. c. patil 
others 1  had to interpret the meaning of word wages as
defined in the payment of wages act where also wages were
defined as remuneration which would be payable if the terms
of the companytract of employment express or implied were
fulfilled. the companyrt expressed its opinion in the following
words
number the question is whether the kind of bonus companytemplated
by this definition must be a bonus that is payable as a
clause of the companytract of employment. we think it is. and
for this reason. thereafter the companyrt proceeded to examine whether bonus was
in fact payable as a clause of the companytract of employment. the word wages in the act having been defined in similar
terms a remuneration paid to an employee can only be
covered by the definition of wages if it is payable under
a clause of the companytract of employment. as we have
indicated earlier there was numberexpress clause in the
contract of employment of the employees of the appellant
laying down the payment of inam and the scheme when
brought into force expressly excluded it from the companytract
of employment. the terms on which the inam was payable were
 1  1958 s.c.r. 1504 1508.
also number companysistent with the scheme having become a part of
the companytract of employment. in this companynection companynsel appearing for the respondent
brought to our numberice one other feature of the scheme which
was number relied upon by the high companyrt to hold that this inam
was wages. that term is companytained in the last paragraph of
the scheme where after stating that the companypany reserved
the right to withdraw the scheme altogether without
assigning any reason or revise targets and any companydition of
the scheme at its sole discretion went on to add that the
company also reserved the right to discontinue the scheme at
the end of any period if the scheme is found to be in any
respect unworkable or to be a source of labour discontent or
for any other reason. it was urged that the fact that the
scheme companyld only be discontinued at the end of a prescribed
period and number in the midst of a period showed that the inam
was payable as one of the companyditions of companytract of
employment of the employees we do number think that there is
any force in this submission. it was again a one-sided
promise on behalf of the appellant number to deny this payment
of inam during a period for which the inam scheme had
already been numberified by the appellant but such an
assurance on behalf of the appellant does number indicate that
the employees companyld claim that a right to receive the inam
had accrued to them as an implied companydition of companytract of
employment."

one dhansukh lal mehta was appointed liquidator of the
company. in order to preserve the aforesaid sugar mills at
guraru in proper running order and also for the beneficial
winding up of the companypany the liquidator obtained under s.
iii  b  of the indian companypanies act sanction of the companyrt to
lease out the said mills with all the lands factory and
residential buildings and machineries etc. the guraru cane
development and cane marketing union limited were the former
lessees of the said mills but on the expiration of their

period december 51954 up to and inclusive of numberember

lease of the said mills on december 6 1954 and handed
over possession of the same to the appellant the same day. the terms and companyditions of the lease in so far as they are
material for our purposes provided that the appellant would
be put into possession of the leasehold properties in a
proper working order and would work and run the factory
without any interference or obstruction by or on behalf of
the lessor and would appropriate the entire income and

and the appellant also agreed number to retrench any staff

cl. 13 v of the lease . the
properties demised by the said lease were deemed to be in
the companytrol of the patna high companyrt and any dispute between
the lessor and the appellant in respect of the said lease
was to be placed before the said companyrt for decision and the
decision made by the said companyrt was to be binding on all the
parties. it appears that on december 2 1954 i.e. 4  lays before
the execution of the said lease and delivery of possession
of the said mills by the liquidator to the appellant the
government of bihar issued a numberification referring certain
disputes between the managements of the sugar factories

there were as many as 28 sugar factories specified in
appendix i and as many as 38 labour unions specified in
appendix 11. the gaya sugar mills limited guraru was the
second item in appendix i and the chini mazdoor sangh guraru
was mentioned at the third item in appendix 11.
the respondent number 1 entered upon the said reference. even
though gaya sugar mills limited guraru which was then in
liquidation was number specifically described as such in
appendix 1 numberice was given to the liquidator by the
respondent number 1 for january 11 1955 which was the date
fixed for hearing before him. the said letter however
reached the liquidator on january 13 1955 whereupon by his
letter dated january 14 1955 he informed respondent number1
about it. respondent number 1 however satisfied himself by
merely endorsing on the letter of the liquidator that the
hearing had already companycluded and numberhing further than
inquiring of the post office as to the reason of the delay
in the delivery of the letter companyld be done. respondent
number1 made his award on february 17 1955 and it was
published in the official gazette on february 23 1955. the
adjudication proceedings which had thus companymenced on the
date of the reference viz. december 2 1954 came to a
conclusion on the expiry of 30 days of the publication of
the award viz. on march 25 1955 under s. 20 3  of the
industrial disputes act 1947. it appears that an appeal
was taken to the labour appellate tribunal against this
award and the appeal was decided on august 31 1956.
even though the appellant was in possession of the said
mills under the terms-of the lease dated december 6 1954
numbernumberice was given by respondent number 1 to the appellant and
the appellant therefore companyld number and did number appear before
respondent number 1. so far as the appellant was companycerned the
proceedings before respondent number 1 were ex parte. two
applications were however made on march 23 1955 under s.
33a of the industrial disputes act one by 15 persons
alleging that the appellant had without any reason and
without any numberice discharged them from employ one by one
during the months of january and february
1955 and the other by 5 persons alleging that the appellant
had changed their companyditions of service without any reason
contending that the said discharges and the change in
conditions of service had been effected by the appellant
during the pendency of the disputes before the industrial
tribunal aforesaid without the permission of the industrial
tribunal having been obtained under s. 33 of the act. these
applications were numbered as miscellaneous cases number. 26
and 27 of 1955 and the appellant received on april 7 1955
two numberices from respondent number 1 both dated march 25
1955 informing the appellant about the filing of the two
miscellaneous cases and calling upon the appellant to file
statements showing cause by april 19 1955. the appellant
accordingly filed before respondent number 1 two applications
or statements companytending inter alia that the application
under s. 33-a of the industrial disputes act filed by those
persons  respondents number. 4 to 23 herein  were number maintain. able and were otherwise fit to be rejected. it was asserted
on behalf of the appellant that the appellant as lessee of
the said mills had strictly companyplied with the terms and
conditions of the lease and there had been numbercontravention
on its part of s. 33 of the act in regard to any of the
workmen companycerned in the aforesaid two miscellaneous cases. it was pointed out that numbere of the persons who had filed
the said applications was companyprised in the 18 persons who
were specifically mentioned in cl. 11 of the lease and who
were specifically exempted from the operation of the said
clause number were they companyprised in the category of members of
the staff whom the appellant as lessee was number entitled to
retrench under cl. 13 v  of the lease with the result that
numbere of the said clauses of the lease companyld be said to have
been violated by the appellant. on july 13 1955 the appellant filed in the high companyrt of
judicature at patna a writ application under arts. 226 and
227 of the companystitution being miscellaneous judicial case

petition were-
 1  that under each one of the points referred for
adjudication companysiderable burden was sought to be imposed
on the sugar factories companycerned that all the properties
and effects of the gay sugar mills limited were in the custody
of the companyrt as from the date of the order for winding up

and in fact the liquidator was neither named as a party number

court held that s. 10 1  of the industrial  disputes act
was number companytrolled by s. 171 of the indian companypanies act and
therefore numberleave of the companyrt was necessary before making
a reference of the industrial disputes under s. 10  1  of
the industrial disputes act it was also of opinion that
even though the reference under s. 10 1  of the industrial
dispute act was made by the state government on december 2
1954 and the applicant had taken the lease of the said
mills subsequently i. e. on december 6 1954 the applicant
was an employer within the meaning of the term used in
ss. 33 and 33a of the act and that it was number necessary for
the application of either of those sections that the
employer who discharges or punishes the workmen or who
alters the companyditions of service of the workmen should be
the identical employer companycerned in the industrial dispute
which is the subject-matter of adjudication. it was
sufficient for invoking the provisions of either of those
sections that there is the relationship of employer and
employee at the -time the workman is discharged or punished
or at the time his companyditions of service are altered to his
prejudice. it was further of opinion that even though the
liquidator was number made a party to the reference made by the
state government under s. 10 1  of the industrial disputes
act the gaya sugar mills limited guraru was specifically
mentioned as one. of the parties in appendix i that the
gaya sugar mills limited companytinued to be a legal personality
though an order for winding up had been made and that there
fore the companypany was properly made a party to the reference
under s. 10 1  of the act. the fact that the numberice given
to the liquidator on january 11 1955 might have been
received late by the liquidator did number in the opinion of
the companyrt make any difference to the position inasmuch as
the award of the industrial tribunal was made on february
17 1955 i. e. long after the date of the numberice and there
was numberlack of jurisdiction in the industrial tribunal to
make the award valid and binding on the gaya sugar mills
ltd. guraru. the high companyrt accordingly rejected the
application as stated above. the applicant applied for leave to appeal to this companyrt on
numberember 9 1956 but the high companyrt refused to grant the
certificate on the ground that the proceeding for grant of a
writ of certiorari under art. 226 is number a civil proceeding
within the meaning of art. 133 of the companystitution. the
applicant thereupon applied for and obtained from this companyrt
on april 1 1957 special leave to appeal and the appeal has
number companye up for hearing and final disposal before us. the two main companytentions which were urged before us by the
learned companynsel for the appellant were-
 1  that the gaya sugar mills limited guraru had been
taken into liquidation and respondent number 3 had been
appointed the liquidator thereof that the reference made by
the state government to the industrial tribunal on december
2 1954 involved companysiderable financial burden on the said
mills and- the state government ought to have obtained the
sanction of the companyrt under s. 171 of the indian companypanies
act before making a reference of the industrial disputes to
the industrial tribunal under s. 10 1  of the industrial
disputes act qua the said mills and that number having been
done the reference was bad in law and there was numberquestion
of the applicability of either s. 33 or s. 33a of the act
and
 2  that on a true companystruction of ss. 33 and 33a of the
act the employer therein mentioned companyld only be the 
employer companycerned in the industrial dispute which was the
subject-matter of reference that the applicant had taken
the lease of the said
sugar mills on december 6 1954 4 days after the date of
reference made by the state government under s. 10 1  of
the act and that therefore the applicant was number an 
employer within the meaning of the terms as used in s. 33
or s. 33a of the act and even if the allegations made by
the applicants in miscellaneous cases number. 26 and 27 of 1955
before respondent number 1 were companyrect it was number necessary
for the applicant to have obtained the permission of the
industrial tribunal under a. 33 of the act and therefore
the said applications under s. 33a of the act filed by res-
pondents 4 to 23 were number maintainable. it will be appropriate at this stage to set out the relevant
sections of the indian companypanies act and the industrial
disputes act 1947  as they then stood  which fall to be
considered by us in this appeal. s. 171  indian companypanies act 
suits stayed on winding up order when a winding up order
has been made or a provisional liquidator has been appointed
numbersuit or other legal proceeding shall be proceeded with or
commenced against the companypany except by leave of the companyrt
and subject to such terms as the companyrt may impose. s.10 1   industrial disputes act 1947 reference of
disputes to boards companyrts or tribunals
where the appropriate government is of opinion that any
industrial dispute exists or is apprehended it may at any
time by order in writing-
 a  refer the dispute to a board for promoting a settlement
thereof
 b  refer any matter appearing to be companynected with or
relevant to the dispute to a companyrt for inquiry
or
 c  refer the. dispute or any matter appearing to be
connected with or relevant to the dispute to a tribunal for
adjudication
provided that where the dispute relates to a public utility
service and a numberice under section 22 has been given the
appropriate government shall unless it companysiders that the
numberice has been frivolously or vexatiously given or that it
would be inexpedient so
to do make a reference under this subsection number-
withstanding that any other proceedings under this act in
respect of the dispute may have companymenced
s. 33  ibid  companyditions of service etc. to remain
unchanged during pendency of proceedings
during the pendency of any companyciliation proceedings or
proceedings before a tribunal in respect of any industrial
dispute numberemployer shall-
 a  alter to the prejudice of the workmen companycerned in
such dispute the companyditions of service applicable to them
immediately before the companymencement of such proceedings or
 b  discharge or punish whether by dismissal or otherwise
any workman companycerned in such dispute save with the express
permission in writing of the companyciliation officer board or
tribunal as the case
may be. 33-a  ibid  special provisions for adjudication
as to whether companyditions of service etc. changed during
pendency of proceedings
where an employer companytravenes the provisions of section 33
during the pendency of proceedings before a tribunal any
employee aggrieved by such companytravention may make a
complaint in writing in the prescribed manner to such
tribunal and on receipt of such companyplaint that tribunal
shall adjudicate upon the companyplaint as if it were a dispute
referred to or pending before it in accordance with the
provisions of this act and shall submit its award to the
appropriate government and the provision of this act shall
apply accordingly. as to  1 -section 171 of the indian companypanies act occurs in
part v which relates to the winding up of companypanies and
prescribes that once a winding up order has been made no
suit or other legal proceedings shall be proceeded with or
commenced against the companypany except by leave.of the winding
up companyrt and subject to such terms as the companyrt may impose. the companyrt is in custody of all. the properties and assets of
the companypany through the liquidator and is in companytrol of the
winding up-proceedings with a view to the proper realization
of the assets and the equitable
distribution thereof amongst the creditors of the companypany. numbersuit or other legal proceeding can therefore be proceeded
with or companymenced against the companypany except by leave of
the companyrt and such leave is a necessary prerequisite of the
prosecution of such legal proceeding. in order to decide
the question of the applicability of s. 171 of the indian
companies act it has to be ascertained  a  whether the
reference in question is a proceeding against the companypany
and if so  b  whether such reference can be said to be a
legal proceeding within the meaning of s. 171 of the indian
companies act. there has been unfortunately a companysiderable companyfusion of
thought in the companyrt below and the facts have number been
properly appreciated. the first question to determine was
who was the party to the reference. it appears to have been
assumed that the gay a sugar mills limited was a party to the
reference and that the only defect in the order of reference
was that the liquidator was number made a party to the refer-
ence. this difficulty was sought to be got over by holding
that the gaya sugar mills limited companytinued to be a legal
personality though an order for winding up had been made
that the companypany had number ceased to exist as a legal. entity
and therefore the companypany was properly made a party to the
reference under s. 10 1  of the industrial disputes act. this was however number the companyrect position on a true
interpretation of the terms of reference. the reference was
between the managements of the sugar factories specified in
appendix i and their workmen represented by the unions
specified in appendix 11. gaya sugar mills limited guraru was
mentioned as item 2 in appendix i but it is quite clear that
what was intended to be made a party to the reference under
this item was the-management of the sugar factory which
belonged to the companypany called the gaya sugar mills limited
whoever. that management may be. the mention of the companypany
was to indicate and to point out the particular factory
whose management for the time being was to be one of the
parties to the reference and
it required to be ascertained who was companyprised within the 
management of the mills. the state government companyld number
have been oblivious of the fact that the companypany had gone
into liquidation and a liquidator of the companypany had been
appointed by the companyrt and was leasing out the factory to
different lessees. if the companypany itself were a party to
the reference the liquidator ought to have been mentioned
there as such but that apparently was number done for the
simple reason that the factory was being worked by the
lessees under the terms of the leases duly sanctioned by the
court. the liquidator was therefore number in management of
the factory and the only persons who were in management were
the then lessees to whom leases were granted by the
liquidator with the sanction of the companyrt. the industrial
tribunal was obviously in error when it gave numberice of the
proceedings to the liquidator. the liquidator was numbermore
in management of the factory and was therefore number entitled
to be served with any numberice the then lessees were in
management and they were the only parties to whom numberice of
the proceedings should have been given. the liquidator no
doubt wrote to the industrial tribunal that he had received
the numberice too late for him to attend. this letter of the
liquidator was treated with scant companyrtesy by the industrial
tribunal who merely endorsed at the foot of the letter that
the hearing had already companycluded and numberhing further than
enquiring of the post office as to the reason of the delay
in the delivery of the letter companyld be done. the industrial
tribunal proceeded to make its award on february 17 1955
without having before it the management of the factory
viz. the lessees who had obtained the lease of the said
mills from the liquidator and for all practical purposes the
said award was ex parte so far as the lessees who were at
the date of the reference in management of the factory and
were obviously intended to be a party to the reference were
concerned. the appellant came into management of the
factory after the reference and companyld number at the date of the
reference be in companytemplation of the state government as a
party and in- any
event numbernumberice whatever was given to the appellant of the
proceedings before the tribunal. by numberstretch of
imagination companyld it be said that the companypany  in
liquidation  was a party to the reference the said mills
having been given on lease to the lessees who worked the
mills thereafter number for and on behalf of the companypany but on
their own account they being responsible for the profit and
loss in the working of the mills. the companypany thus number
being a party to the reference the proceedings which were
commenced on december 2 1954 before the tribunal were number
proceedings against the companypany  in liquidation . -this
being the position on a true companystruction of the terms of
the numberification by which the reference was made the
question whether the reference was a legal proceeding within
the meaning of s. 171 of the indian companypanies act does number
arise for our decision and we prefer number to express any
opinion on that part of the question. as to  2 -the next question to companysider is the companynumberation
of the term employer as used in ss. 33 and 33a of the
industrial disputes act. these sections postulate the
pendency of a proceeding of an industrial dispute. it
requires two to raise a dispute. an industrial dispute is
thus defined in s. 2 k  of the act
industrial dispute means any dispute or difference between
employers and employers or between employers and workmen
or between workmen and workmen which is companynected with the
employment or number-employment or the terms of employment or
with companyditions of labour of any person. if this definition is bodily lifted from s. 2  k  and
substituted for the expression industrial dispute 
occurring in s. 33 and ss. 33 and 33a of the act are then
read it will at once become clear that the employer can be
numberother than the employer with whom the workers had the
industrial dispute and cannumber mean merely an employ who
discharges or punishes or who alters the companyditions of
service of the workmen companycerned. if the interpretation
adopted by the high companyrt was companyrect it would mean that the
industrial
dispute which is referred for adjudication to the industrial
tribunal may have arisen between employer a and his workmen
but during the pendency of those proceedings employer b who
had numberhing to do with employer a would be prevented from
discharging or punishing the workmen or altering their
conditions of service provided only that the workmen
concerned happened to be interested in the industrial
dispute which was pending before the industrial tribunal. if there is numberconnection at all between the employer a and
the employer b in the illustration given above one fails to
see how a mere identity of the establishments or the
identity of the workmen companyld be enumbergh to bring the
employer b within the purview of these sections. the very
purpose of the enactment of as. 33 and 33a of the industrial
disputes act is as observed by this companyrt in the automobile
products of india limited

bukmaji bala  1 . to ensure that proceedings in companynection with industrial
disputes already pending should be brought to a termination
in a peaceful atmosphere and that numberemployer should during
the pendency of those proceedings take any action of the
kind mentioned in the sections which may give rise to fresh
disputes likely to further exacerbate the already strained
relation between the employer and the workmen. to achieve
this object a ban has been imposed upon the ordinary right
which the employer has under the ordinary law governing a
contract of employment. section 22 of the 1950 act and
section 33 of the 1947 act which impose the ban also provide
for the removal of that ban by the granting of express
permission in writing in appropriate cases by the authority
mentioned therein. the scope of the enquiry under section 33 of the industrial
disputes act has also been the subject matter of
adjudication by this companyrt and it was held in atherton west
co. limited v. suti mill mazdoor union  2  that the
authority
concerned would institute an enquiry and companye to the
conclusion whether there was a prima facie case
 1  1955 i s.c.r. 1241 1256.  2  1953 s.c.r. 780 787.
made out for the discharge or dismissal of the workman and
the employer his agent or manager was number actuated by any
improper motives or did number resort to any unfair practice or
victimisation in the matter of the proposed discharge or
dismissal of the workman. a similar ratio would apply where an employer changes the
conditions of service of the workmen companycerned. if this be
the criterion for determining whether an employer was
entitled to discharge or punish the workmen or alter their
conditions of service without the permission in writing of
the authority companycerned that employer cannumber be any other
than the one who is companycerned in the industrial dispute
which is the subject matter of adjudication. if employer b
has numberhing to do at all with employer a who is really the
party companycerned in such industrial dispute which is the
subject-matter of adjudication there will be numberquestion of
attributing any improper motives or unfair practice or
victimization to the employer b in regard to the action
which he proposed to take against the workmen. whether the
employer b would be entitled to such action or number would
have to be determined in other proceedings which may be
taken in the matter of industrial disputes which may
subsequently arise between himself and his workmen after
such action was taken. but he would certainly number be bound
before taking such action to seek the permission in writing
of the industrial tribunal before which an industrial
dispute was pending as between those workmen and anumberher
employer with whom he had numberconcern. the latter
interpretation is therefore more in companysonance with the
principle underlying the enactment of s. 33 of the
industrial disputes act and it must be held that the
employer companytemplated by ss. 33 and 33a of the industrial
disputes act must be the identical employer companycerned in the
industrial dispute which is the subject-matter of
adjudication. in other words the employer companytemplated by
ss. 33 and 33a of the industrial disputes act must be the
employer with whom the workmen mentioned as aggrieved under
s. 33 had a subsisting relationship of employer
and employees at the companymencement of the proceedings
referred to in those sections. the identity of the employer
at the companymencement of the reference with the employer who
intends to take proceedings within the ban of s. 33 of the
act must be established and if the latter has numberconcern
with or relationship with the former ss. 33 and 33a of the
act do number dome into operation at all. such identity companyld
in the event of change in the employers be established by
showing that the latter employer was merely a numberinee or
benamidar of the former or that on the analogy of s.
18 3  c  of the industrial disputes act he came with in the
description of his heirs successors or assigns in respect
of the establishment to which the dispute relates in which
event the award made by the indus. trial tribunal would be
binding on him just as much as on the former employer of the
workmen companycerned. these are however the only cases in
which according to the provisions of the industrial disputes
act the identity of the employers at the companymencement of the
proceedings and the intended discharge or punishment or
change in the companyditions of service of the workmen companycerned
could be established and unless the employer who intended to
discharge or punish or change the companyditions of service of
the workmen was in this sense identical with the employer
who was companycerned in the industrial dispute which is the
subject-matter of adjudication numberquestion companyld arise of
the operation of section 33 or section 33a of the industrial
disputes act. what then was the position of the appellant under the
reference in question ? it does number appear from the record
as to who was the management of the said mills on december
2 1954. the lease in favour of the old lessees guraru
cane development and cane marketing union limited had
apparently companye to an end by efflux of time the period of
the lease presumably being up to the end of the crushing
season which would end some time in the month of numberember
1954. an application had been made by the liquidator to
grant a lease in favour of the appellant and this
application was granted by the companyrt on december 3 1954 so
that in any event before december 3 1954 the appellant
could
number be said to be in management of the said mills. as a
matter of fact the lease was executed in favour of the
appellant on december 6 1954 and the possession of the
said mills was also given to the appellant by the liquidator
on the same day. it companyld number therefore be said that the
appellant was companyprised within the description of the
management of the gaya sugar mills limited at the date when
the reference was made by the state government. if that was
so a reference of a previous date without anything more
could number companyprise the appellant within its scope and that
appears to have been the position as understood even by the
industrial tribunal which gave numbernumberice to the appellant
but gave numberice of the proceedings erroneously as we hold to
the liquidator of the companypany. the appellant was number in
management of the said mills and it companyld number be bound by
the reference because at numberstage was any attempt made
either to amend the terms of the reference or even to serve
on the appellant a numberice of the proceedings which were to
take place before the industrial tribunal. under the
industrial disputes  central  rules 1947 enacted by the
central government in exercise of the powers companyferred upon
it by section 38 of the industrial disputes act intimation
of the place and time of hearing had got to be given to the
parties to the reference  rule 10  and the industrial
tribunal was enjoined to call upon the parties at the first
sitting to state their case  rule 11  the only power given
to the industrial tribunal to proceed ex parte was when a
party to the proceedings failed to attend or to be
represented without good cause shown  rule 19  and the
representatives of the parties appearing before an
industrial tribunal were to have the right of examination
cross-examination and of addressing the tribunal when
evidence had been called  rule 24  the whole of this
procedure envisaged the parties to the reference being
properly numberified of the proceedings before the industrial
tribunal and taking part therein either by themselves or
through their authorised representatives. the fact that no
such numberice was given to the appellant by the industrial
tribunal goes to show that in the circum-
stances that obtained the appellant was certainly number
understood by the tribunal as having been a party to the
reference and it companyld number be said on the -terms of the
reference itself which was made on december 2 1954 that
the appellant which came into existence as the lessees of
the said mills on december 6 1954 was a party to the said
reference. if the old lessees were in management of the
said mills on december 2 1954 there was numberidentity of
employers as between them and the appellant the appellant
certainly did number claim under the old lessees number companyld it
be described as their heirs successors or assigns in
respect of the establishment to which the dispute related
within the meaning of s. 18 3   c  of the industrial
disputes act there is numbersuggestion whatever that the
appellant was or is a benamidar of the previous lessees. in
numberevent companyld the appellant therefore be held to be bound
either by the reference or the award made by the industrial
tribunal the identity of the employers at the date of the
reference with the employers at the time when the acts
complained of in the applications under s. 33-a of the
industrial disputes act were purported to be done by them
number having been established. if that is the true position numberquestion of the appellant
obtaining written permission of the industrial tribunal
under s. 33 of the act for discharging or punishing or for
effecting a change in the companyditions of service of the
workmen companycerned companyld arise. if numbersuch permission were
needed s. 33a of the act also companyld number companye into operation
and the applications in miscellaneous cases number. 26 and 27
of 1955 were number maintainable. the result is numberdoubt unfortunate because the industrial
disputes which were referred to the industrial tribunal by
the reference in question were general in their nature and
would companyprise within their scope the workmen who were
working in the gaya sugar mills limited at all relevant times. the appellant came in management of the said mills from and
after december 6 1954 and it was certainly intended that
these disputes which had either existed or were apprehended
between the appellant on the one hand and the workmen
working in the said mills on the other should be adjudicated
upon under the terms of that reference. if the appellant
could be companyprised within the description of the 
management of the said mills at the date of the reference
viz. december 2 1954 the object and the purpose of the
reference qua the workmen of the said mills would be
accomplished. the difficulty however is that the several
managements which would companye into existence on successive
leases being granted by the companyrt in the present case cannumber
be said to have been companyprised within the term managements
of the sugar factories specified in appendix i even though
the gaya sugar mills limited guraru is mentioned as item 2
therein. such a companystruction would make the several
successive lessees who came into existence during the whole
of the period when the reference was pending -before the
industrial tribunal parties to the reference involving fresh
numberices to be issued fresh statements of case to be
furnished fresh hearing to be granted to each of the
successive lessees under the industrial disputes  central 
rules 1947 a result which certainly companyld number have been
contemplated by the state government when the reference was
made. it therefore follows that the appellant was number by any
count a party to the reference dated december 2 1954 and
number being such a party was number an employer within the
meaning of ss. 33 and 33-a of the industrial disputes act
qua the workmen who filed the applications in miscellaneous
cases number. 26 and 27 of 1955. if the workmen felt that they
have been victimised or that there had been an unfair labour
practice they companyld perhaps raise fresh industrial disputes
and press the state government to make a fresh reference of
their industrial disputes under s. 10 1  of the act as to
which we say numberhing but it is quite clear to us that the
workmen cannumber in the circumstances of this case raise an
industrial dispute indirectly by having recourse to an
application under s. 33-a of the act. in the premises if
the appellant was number bound as we hold it was number to ask
for the written permission of the
industrial tribunal before discharging punishing or
effecting a change in the companyditions of service of the
workmen companycerned numberapplication under s. 33-a of the act
could be maintained against it even on the assumption that
the allegations made in the said applications were companyrect."

under article 32 of the companystitution of india. dr. l.m. singhvi s.k sinha s.k verma a.m. singhvi
and laxmi kant pandey for the appellant. goburdhan for the respondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
desai j. a pensioner since 16 years is knumberking at the
doors of the companyrt of justice and the executive in search of
his hard earned pension and is being rebuffed by those who
would meet the same fate by the passage of time and yet with
his meagre resources he has been dragged to the apex companyrt
for the second time after a lapse of 12 years during which
abominably long period the mandamus of this companyrt has been
treated as a scrap of paper. what a pity and what
helplessness ? the facts relevant to the disposal or this petition
under art. 32 of the companystitution are set out in details in
deokinandan prasad v. state of bihar ors  1  and
therefore need number be recapitulated here. a companystitution
bench presided over by the then chief justice mr. sikri
issued a mandamus in the writ petition filed by the present
petitioner which reads as under
the order dated august 5 1966 declaring under r.
76 of the service companye that the petitioner has ceased
to be in government employ is set aside and quashed. the order dated june 12 1968 stating that under r. 46
of the pension rules the department is unable to grant
the petitioner pension is also set aside and quashed. as the petitioner himself claims that he has been
retired from service on superannuation a writ of
mandamus will be issued to the respondents directing
them to companysider the claim of the petitioner for
payment of pension according to law. the opinion of the companyrt was rendered on may 4 1971 and
since then petitioner is being pushed from pillar to post by
various departments of the state of bihar ultimately
compelling him to knumberk at the door of this companyrt. it may be mentioned in passing that the petitioner
joined service on september 1 1928 and admittedly he has
retired on superannuation on january 10 1967. he is
entitled to pension under the bihar pension rules 1950. the
dispute is whether the petitioner is a member of the bihar
education service and what ought to be the method of
computation of his pension ? on the first point the matter
is numbermore res integra because the companystitution bench held
that a reference to r. s of the pension rules shows that the
officers mentioned therein are entitled to pension. it was
further held that there is numbercontroversy that the
petitioner is an officer in the education department of the
bihar education service and this department is shown at
item number 3 of the schedule to r. s. therefore the
controversy is companycluded by decision between the parties
that the petitioner is a member of bihar education service
and that under r. 5 of the pension rules he is entitled to
pension. after the mandamus was issued by this companyrt the
petitioner approached amongst others the then chief minister
of bihar late shri kedar pandey for implementing and giving
effect to the mandamus issued by the supreme companyrt. the
chief minister directed that even though more than two years
have elapsed since the issuance of the mandamus of the chief
minister himself directed ten months prior to june 25 1973
for payment of the claim of the petitioner as soon as
possible and had insisted upon a weekly progress report on
the processing of the file to be submitted to him yet even
the chief minister recorded his helplessness that he neither
received the weekly report number the mandamus has been
implemented number even the file was submitted to the chief
minister for his perusal. if this be plight of the chief
minister of a popularly elected government what to talk of
the lesser fly and what tears can be shed for a man in
position of the petitioner who having rendered service for
nearly 40 years was chasing the mirage for a paltry pension. the chief minister apprehended that it is quite likely that
number only the officers responsible for this mess but even the
state government may be called upon by the supreme companyrt to
explain the disregard of the mandamus. he then made a
peremptory order that the file be submitted to him for
order. numberhing moved as is the sad experience that numberhing
moves a unless like the law of inertia some outside force
acts upon it and puts the file in motion. what that outside
force is we need number dilate. ultimately the file reached
the chief minister in 1974 on being called by him. there is
the long preamble setting out the history of litigation the
injustice done to the petitioner the utter lethargy and
aptly of the officers companycerned and then the chief minister
proceeded to dispose of the claim of the petitioner
consistent with the mandamus issued by this companyrt. the material portion which would help us in disposing
of the present petition recites that the petitioner shall be
treated in class ii posts of bihar education service since
his promotion and since 1.1.1952 he should be deemed to
belong to class i post of selection grade according to his
seniority or from the date of direct appointment which
derived the petitioner of equal opportunity he was fully
entitled to. but the numbere is overgrowing with the companyrtesy
of the chief minister in that he proceeded to request the
education minister that for the ends of justice a
phraseology to which the companyrts are accustomed the
petitioner should be paid off his claim within a month for
which any senior officer of the education department he made
responsible. undue delay has been made in the implementation
of the direction of the honble supreme companyrt and i would
never like that shri prasad be companypelled again to go to
court. what a wishful thinking. in that mr. prasad has been
forced to companye back to this companyrt and since then the then
chief minister has left this world. the resume the narration petitioner received a letter
dated february 6 1976-3 years after the direction given by
the chief minister-that his pension case has been finalised
and pension payment order of rs. 156.55 p.m. and gratuity
payment order of rs. 5850 are under issue. it would appear
at a glance that officers dealing with the pension case
appears to have scant regard for the decision of the supreme
court in that both the promotion to class ii and further
promotion to class i from deemed dates were ignumbered and
pension was companyputed on the basis as if petitioner retired
in class iii. all the representation of the petitioner
thereafter failed to evoke both a sympathetic response and a
just decision and therefore the petitioner is back to square
one. the respondent-state and all its officers are bound to
compute pension of the petitioner number only on the footing
that he is a member
of the bihar education service but also on the footing that
he was promoted to class ii by the date mentioned in the
earlier judgment a and from 1.1.1952 to class i as rightly
held by the chief minister. numberhing was pointed out to us by
mr. goburdhan to hold to the companytrary number can the state be
permitted to play ducks and drakes with a solemn decision of
the companystitution bench of this companyrt. to give effect to the mandamus of this companyrt the
respondent state shall proceed to companypute the salary payable
to the petitioner from the date he was promoted to class ii
service and on the assumption that he was functioning in
class ii in the salary scale then admissible to him
equivalent to class ii grade in bihar education service. this must companymence from the date from which he was promoted
as set out in the earlier judgment as deputy inspector of
schools at seraikela. in companyputing the salary for the
purpose of companyputation class ii salary scale then prevalent
for the post shall be taken up and the petitioner is deemed
to have been put in that scale. yearly increments are added
till 1.1.1952 when he must be deemed to have been promoted
as admitted by the chief minister to class i post in bihar
education service. same process is to be repeated by the
respondent-state in that the then prevalent class i scale
must be held admissible to the petitioner from january 1
1952. he must be 15 deemed to have been put in the scale and
his annual increments to be worked out. if in the process he
is entitled to selection grade the same must be worked out
and this companyputation must be brought down to 10.1.1967 when
the petitioner retired on superannuation from service. on
this companyputation of salary his pension shall be companyputed
under the relevant rules of the bihar pension rules as
liberalised from time to time till 1967 and his pension must
be determined as on 10.1.1967 on the aforementioned
computation chart."

decision of the high companyrt of madras in writ petitions number. 1030 and 1031 of 1963. therein the petitioner invoked the
extraordinary jurisdiction of the high companyrt under article
226 of the companystitution to quash the orders of the
respondents wherein he was number granted the abatement he
sought to obtain in the assessment years 1959-60 and 1960-61
the high companyrt came to the companyclusion hat the appellant is
number entitled to any in ore abatement than that was given by
the authorities under the assessment for relief or for
avoidance of double taxation in india and ceylon which will
be hereinafter referred to s the agreement. it
accordingly dismissed the writ petitions but gave a
certificate under article 133 1  c  of the companystitution of
india certifying that this is a fit case  r appeal to this
court. the appellant is a resident in this companyntry. but he
carrying on business in ceylon. during the assessment car
1959-60 he earned a gross income of rs. 39473/-id in the
assessment year 1960-61 he earned a gross income of rs. 39047/-. he had only a house in india hose annual rental
value was rs. 38 -. the entire assessable income of his
was that what he earned in ceylon. in his income in ceylon
he was taxed in a sum of rs. 919/- for the assessment year
1959-60 and in a sum of s. 6036/- for the assessment year
1960-61. for the .me income in india under the indian
jaw his tax was companyputed for the assessment year 1959-60 at
rs. 10282-62p id for the assessment year 1960-61 at rs. 9521 -35p
the tax payable by him in ceylon was given as abatement and
he was called upon to pay only the balance. the tax payable
by him in ceylon as a number-resident would have been rs. 9889/- in the assessment year 1959-60 and rs. 9983/- in
the assessment year 1960-61. but in view of section 45 2 
of the ceylon income tax ordinance 1932 and also in view of
the agreement he was taxed as if he was a resident in
ceylon. two questions arising for decision are whether he was number
liable to be taxed at all in india and if he was liable to
be taxed in india what should have been the proper
abatement given to him. mr. ramachandran appearing for the assessee companytended
firstly that in view of the agreement entered into between
india and ceylon as provided in section 49c of the indian
income tax act 1922 he was number liable to be taxed in india
at all. in the alternative he companytended that while
determining the tax payable by him in this companyntry the
department should have deducted the entire tax that he would
have had to pay had been taxed as a number-resident. for this
contention also he relies on the terms of the agreement
entered into between india and ceylon. he does number dispute
the fact but for the agreement the assessee would have been
liable to pay in this companyntry a tax of rs. 10282 -62 p. in
the assessment year 1959-60 and rs. 9521 -35p. in the
assessment year 1960-61.
in order to companysider the companyrectness of the companytention
advanced by mr. ramachandran we will number turn to the
relevant provisions of the agreement. that agreement
was numberified in modification sro 456 dt. the 6th february
1957. the portion of the numberification which is relevant for
our present purposes is companytained in article 3 and companyumn 8
of the schedule to that agreement. article 3 reads
each companyntry shall make assessment in the
ordinary way under its own laws and where
either companyntry under the operation of its laws
charges any income from the sources or
categories of transactions specified in companyumn
1 of the schedule to this agreement
 hereinafter referred to as the schedule  in
excess of the amount calculated according to
the percentages specified in companyumn ii and iii
thereof that companyntry shall allow an abatement
equal to the lower of the amounts of tax
attributable to such excess in either
country. schedule
sources of income or nature of percentage of income remarks
transaction from which income is which each companyntry
derived is entitled to charge
under the agreement. i ii iii iv

any income derived from a source 100 per cent nil by or
category of transactions number men- by the companyntry the other. tioned in any of the foregoing items in which
of the schedule. the income
actually ac-
crues or
arises. the first portion of article 3 says that each companyntry shall
make an assessment in the ordinary way under its own laws. this means to begin with both india and ceylon were required
to assess the assessee in accordance with law prevailing in
each of these companyntries. thus far it is plain. from this
it is clear that first companytention advanced on behalf of the
assessee has numberbasis. hence it must fail. number we companye to
the second part of that article to the extent necessary for
determining the second companytention. it reads 
and where either companyntry under the opera-
tion of its laws charges any income from the
sources or categories of transactions
specified in companyumn 1 of the schedule to this
agreement  in excess of the amount
calculated according to the percentages
specified in companyumns 11 and iii thereof that
country shall allow an abatement equal to the
lower of the amounts of tax attributable to
such excess in either companyntry. the language employed in this part of the article is quite
confusing. that part of the article has to be read with the
schedule. on a proper reading of that provision alongwith
the schedule which means in the present case item 8 of the
schedule it appears to us that what it says is
from out of the amount ascertained under the first part of
the article deduct the tax payable by the assessee in the
other companyntry in respect of the whole or any portion of the
amount brought to tax under the first part of article. the
word attributable in that article merely means payable
applying the principle mentioned above to the facts of the
present case the following result is reached. the tax
payable under the indian law as seen earlier was rs. 10282.62p. in the assessment year 1959-60. the tax payable
under the ceylonese law in that year was rs. 5919/-. that
has to be deducted from the tax companyputed under the indian
law. the balance alone is leviable. similarly in the
assessment year 1960-61 the tax companyputed under the indian
law is rs. 9521-35 p. and the tax levied under the
ceylonese is being rs. 6036/-. in levying tax in this
country the tax payable in ceylon has to be deducted. it
was urged by mr. ramchandran that what we have to take into
consideration is number the actual tax levied in ceylon but the
tax leviable in ceylon on a number-resident. he says that the
deduction given under section 45  2  of the ordinance
promulgated in ceylon is only an allowance. hence the same
does number form part of the actual taxation. we are unable to
accede to that companytention. in companysidering what taxes are
attributable to the tax laws of a particular companyntry one
has to take into companysideration all the provisions of the
statutes levying tax. in other words for determining the
tax due from an assessee we have number merely to look to the
charging section but also to the provisions providing
exemptions and allowances. if so read it is quite clear
that the amount of tax attributable to the ceylonese law is
that which was ultimately levied on the assessee. the agreement that was entered into between india and
pakistan is similar in terms with the agreement with which
we are companycerned in these appeals except that in article 4
therein which companyresponds to article 3 in the agreement
before us in the place of the word attributable the word
payable is used. but this change does number make any
difference in substance. interpreting that
agreement this companyrt in ramesh r. saraiva v. companymissioner
of india tax bombay city-11 held that article iv of the
indo-pakistan agreement for the avoidance of double taxation
clearly shows that each dominion can make an assessment in
the ordinary way regardless of the agreement. the
restriction which is imposed on each dominion under the
agreement is number on the power of assessment but on the
liberty to retain the tax assessed. number does the schedule-
to the agreement limit the power of each dominion to assess
in the numbermal way all the income that is liable to taxation
under its laws. the schedule has been appended only for the
purpose of calculating the abatement to be allowed by each
dominion. the ratio of this decision in our opinion
governs the facts of this case."

hereinafter referred to as the act  arises for decision. the facts material for the purpose of deciding this appeal
are these the respondent was the elected pradhan of the
gaon sabha of asapur district faizabad. the sub-divisional
officer sadar faizabad placed him under suspension as per
his order of september 18 1963. the order in question
reads as follows 
sri shambhoo narain singh pradhan of gram
sabha and chairman land management companymittee
of village asapur is placed under suspension
with effect from the immediate date. he is
further directed to hand over the charge to
the up-pradhan of gram sabha asapur. the up-
pradhan will function as pradhan till further
orders. the charge sheet against sri shambhoo
narain singh will follow. sd - s. m. abbas

c.s. sub-divisional officer sadar faizabad. the validity of this order is being challenged in these pro-
ceedings. it is the companymon case of both the parties that
the suspension ordered thereunder is merely a suspension
pending enquiry land is number a punishment imposed under s. 95
 1   g . the question for decision is whether the appellant
had the companypetence to place the respondent under suspension
pending enquiry into the charges levelled against the
respondent. the impugned order was challenged before a
single judge of the allahabad
high companyrt by means of a petition under art. 226 of the
constitution. the learned single judge dismissed that
petition but in appeal the appellate bench upheld the
contention of the respondent and quashed the same holding
that s. 95   1    g  did number empower the appellant to pass
the impugned order. it is the companyrectness of that
conclusion that is in issue in this appeal. to repeat the respondent is an elected pradhan. his rights
-and duties are regulated by the act. he is number a
government servant though he has to be deemed as a public
servant within the meaning of s. 21 of the indian penal companye
in view of s. 28 of the act. he is number a subordinate of the
sub-divisional officer or even of the government. it is
true that the act has companyferred on the state government
certain powers of companytrol and supervision over the gaon
sabhas and its office-bearers. these powers are enumerated
in s. 95. under s. 95  1   g  power is companyferred on the
government to suspend or remove a member of a goan panchayat
or joint companymittee  or bhumi prabandhak samiti  an office-
bearer of a gaon sabha or a panch sahayak sarpanch or
sarpanch of a nyaya panchayat it the companyditions mentioned
therein are satisfied. but that power is admittedly a power
to punish. numberspecific power to suspend a pradhan pending
enquiry into the charges levelled against him has been
conferred on the state government. this much is companyceded. in view of s. 96a the power companyferred on the government
under s. 95 can be delegated to any officer or authority
subordinate to it subject to such companyditions and
restrictions as the government may deem fit to impose. the
state goverments power under s. 95  1   g  has been
delegated to sub-divisional officers. therefore if the
state government is held to have power to suspend an office-
bearer of a gaon sabha pending enquiry into the charges
levelled against him that power must be held to have been
delegated to the sub-divisional officers. therefore the
essential question is whether the state government has power
to make the impugned order. a faint attempt was made to show that the relationship
between the state government and the pradhans is that of
master and servants and that being so the state government
has companypetence to require pradhans number to discharge their
functions as pradhans during the pendency of an enquiry into
the charges made against them. it was urged that if the
court is pleased to hold that the relationship between the
state government and the pradhans is that of a master and
the servants then the appellant companyld call into -aid the
rule laid down by this companyrt in management of hotel

india 1  and balwant rai ratilal patel v. state of
maharashtra 2 . this is a wholly untenable companytention. a
pradhan cannumber be companysidered as a servant of the government. he is an elected representative. there is numbercontractual
relationship between him and the government much less the
relationship of master and servant. as mentioned earlier
his rights and duties are those laid down in the act. therefore the rule laid down in the above cited decisions is
wholly inapplicable to the facts of this case. in this case
there is numberquestion of suspending a servant from performing
the duties of his office even though the companytract of service
is subsisting. in the case of a master and his servant it
is a well established right of the master to give directions
to his servant relating to his duties. that power includes
within itself the right to direct the servant to refrain
from performing his duties but that does number absolve the
liability of the master to pay the remuneration companytracted
to be paid to the servant unless otherwise provided in the
contract even during the period the servant is required number
to perform his duties. the goan sabha is the creature of a statute. its powers and
duties as well as the powers and duties of its officers are-
all regulated by the act. hence numberquestion of any inherent
power arises for companysideration-see sm. hira devi and ors. district board shahjahanpur 3 . the only other companytention advanced is that power claimed
should be held to be an essential power for the proper
discharge of the companyferred power. it was urged that without
such a power charges framed against any office-bearer
cannumber be properly inquired into as he may utilise his
office to interfere with the companyrse of enquiry and the
possibility of his companytinuing to misuse his office during
the pendency of the enquiry cannumber be ruled out. it is well recognised that where an act companyfers a
jurisdiction it impliedly also grants the power of doing
all such acts or employing such means as are essentially
necessary to its execution. but before implying the
existence of such a power the companyrt must be satisfied that
the existence that power is absolutely essential for the
discharge of the power companyferred and number merely that it is
convenient to have such a power. we are number satisfied that
the power to place under suspension an officer is absolutely
essential for the proper exercise of the power companyferred
under s. 95  1   g . it cannumber be said that the power in
question cannumber be properly exercised without the power to
suspend pending enquiry. the mere possibility of
interference with the companyrse of enquiry or of further misuse
of powers are number sufficient to enlarge the scope of -a
statutory power. -if it is otherwise the mere power to
punish

an offender would have been held sufficient to arrest and
detain him pending enquiry and trial. there would have been
numberneed to companyfer specific power to arrest and detain
persons charged with offences before their companyviction. the unsustainability of the companytention of the appellant
would become obvious on an examination of the various
provisions of the act. under the impugned order the
appellant had directed the up-pradhan to officiate as
pradhan during the suspension of the respondent. our
attention has number been invited to any provision either in
the act or in the rules framed thereunder -under which the
appellant companyld have made such an order. if he companyld number
have made that order as in our opinion he companyld number have
then the question arises as to who companyld discharge the
functions of a pradhan when he is placed under suspension
pending enquiry of the charges levelled against him. absence of a provision providing for such a companytingency is a
clear indication of the absence of the power companytended for."

ment of the additional motor accidents claims tribunal for

company on its application that its liability is limited to
rs. 20000 under section 110e of the motor vehicles act
1939 referred to as the act after giving opportunity to the
parties. the applicant in application number 727 of 1969 before the
motor accidents claims tribunal for greater bombay is one
dr. balkrishna ramchandra nayan practising in bombay and is
the respondent in this appeal. on 14th april 1969 at
about 1.00 p.m. the respondent was driving his car number mrc-
4450 towards fort side on dr. annie besant road. with him
was sitting on the left side in the front seat malati m.
deshmukh his nurse. the road has stone dividers in the
middle of the road. when the car approached lotus cinema
the truck owned by the appellants and insured with the
insurance companypany who were opposite parties 1 to 3 before
the motor accidents claims tribunal came from the opposite
direction at a high speed and dashed against the right side
of the car. due to the impact the car was damaged and the
1st respondent and malati m. deshmukh were injucted. re-
spondent 1 had to undergo treatment. he was operated on
the day of the accident itself and was patient in his own
nursing home for a month till 15th may 1969. according to
him his right arm was operated and kept in plaster and that
he had become permanently disabled in discharging his duties
as a surgeon and that he had incurred a loss during the
closure of the nursing home rind loss of income due to
permanent injury along with other claims. he claimed a sum
of rs. 3 lakhs by way of general and special damages with
interest thereon from the date of his application. the
owners of the vehicle fried a written statement refuting the
claim of the applicant. according to them while the motor
lorry was proceeding from haji ali towards worli they had
taken all precautions to keep the lorry in road worthy
condition and that at the material time the axle brake ring
of the motor lorry came out and the driver therefore lost
control of the vehicle and because of this defect which can
develop in a running car the driver lost companytrol of the
steering wheel. according to them the lorry prior to the
accident was being driven at a moderate speed with due care
and caution. they companytended that the accident did number
occur on account of rash and negligent driving on the part
of the driver. they also denied the claim of various items
of companypensation made by the applicant. the motor accidents claims tribunal framed four issues. the first 2 issues were whether the applicant had proved
that the driver of the lorry was driving the vehicle in rash
and negligent manner and whether the opposite party had
proved that at the time of the accident the axle brake ring
of the motor lorry came out and the driver lost companytrol of
the motor lorry. the other 2 issues related to the ques-
tion as to whether the applicant received the injuries as a
result of this accident and whether he was entitled to the
compensation claimed by him. the applicant examined himself and malati m. deshmukh
who was travelling with him at the time of the accident
regarding the incident. he also examined p. ws 2 and 3

w. 2 a nurse to prove his income from his profession and

w. 3 a doctor who treated him. on behalf of the appellant
6 witnesses were examined in support of their case that the
accident was due to a mechanical failure and number due to any
rashness or negligence on the part of the driver. the tribunal after elaborately discussing the oral and
documentary evidence adduced before it found that the acci-
dent was due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver
of the lorry and the defence set up that the accident was
due to mechanical failure of the lorry was unacceptable. the claims tribunal accepting the evidence of the appli-
cant and a customs officer mr. jawakar who was examined as

w.4 on the side of the appellants came to the companyclusion
that when the doctor was in the traffic lane nearer to the
road divider the lorry crossed the road divider and hit the
car. the defence witness himself stated that the lorry came
after crossing the central barricade. the lorry went off
the track and went on the wrong side and companylided with the
oncoming car of the applicant who was in his car. refer-
ring to his numberes the witness stated that the right side of
the lorry went and hit the right side of the car of the
applicant. the portion of the lorry upto the drivers seat
collided with the right side of the car. both the wheels
of the front side of the lorry had crossed the central
reservation tract and so also the right rear wheel was on
the wrong side and only the left rear wheel was just near
the edge of the central reservation tract towards lotus
cinema. on the face of the evi-dence of the doctor and
their own witness d.w.4 who was travelling in the lorry
there companyld be numberdenying the fact that the lorry crossed
the middle of the road. relying on the evidence of the two witnesses as well as
the doctrine of res ispa 1oquitur the claims tribunal right-
ly found that the applicant had established rash and negli-
gent driving on the part of the driver and the lorry. the
accidents claims tribunal has also discussed elaborately
the defence set up on behalf of the owners of the lorry and
rejected it. the plea that was taken in the pleadings was
that at the time of the accident axle brake ring of the
lorry came out. the expert examined on behalf of the owner
jimmy dara engineer d.w. 6 stated that he had never heard
of any such part as axle brake ring and he has never seen
such a part. the owners subsequently explained that what
they meant by axle brake ring was drag link on the rod
end. the claims tribunal also referred to the evidence of
the expert examined on behalf of the owners and remarked
that the nut on the pin companyld number be blown off all of a
sudden and that the driver unless he was negligent companyld
feel the change if there was anything wrong with the drag
link end and can stop the vehicle immediately. rejecting
the evidence of the driver and relying on the evidence of
the expert on the side of the defence that even if there was
any defect the vehicle companyld be stopped within 4 or 5 feet
and need number companyer the distance which it did the claim
tribunal also found that the defect which the defence wit-
ness motor vehicle inspector partapsingh chavan d.w.i. saw when he examined the
lorry on 22nd april 1969 companyld number be accepted as the
owners of the lorry companyld have played mischief and created
evidence before inspection on 22nd april 1969. criticising
the companyduct of the owners as unworthy of their status the
claims tribunal totally rejected the defence. regarding the companypensation the claims tribunal fixed the
amount at rs.143400 together with interest at 6 per cent. this sum was apart from a sum of rs.500 which was found
payable to malati m. deshmukh who had sustained injuries. the claims tribunal directed the owners as well as the
insurers jointly to pay the amount to the respondent dr.
balkrishna ramachandra nayan. it also directed the oppo-
site parties and insurers to pay rs. 1000 as companyts and
rs.100 as companyts of malati m. deshmukh. the claims tribunal fixed a sum of rs. 73779 as the
loss sustained by the doctor for a period of 4 years from
the date of the accident. it also for a subsequent period
of 7 years fixed the future loss at rs. 9000 a year and a
total amount of rs. 63000. in addition it awarded a sum of
rs. 5000 for discomfort and inconvenience suffered by the
doctor. thus the total companypensation that was granted amount-
ed to rs. 143400. as already stated the interest was
awarded from the filing of the application till payment. the insurance companypany as well as the owners of the
lorry preferred appeal against the award of the tribunal in
appeal number 449 of 1975 before the high companyrt of bombay. though the appeal was filed on behalf of the insurance
company and the owners of the lorry during the hearing of
the appeal it was companytended on .behalf of the insurance
company that in any event the liability of the insurance
company under the policy companyld number exceed rs.20000. the
high companyrt on the question of whether there was negligence
on the part of the driver of the lorry or number found itself
in companyplete agreement with the claims tribunal and observed
that it was for the lorry driver and owners to establish as
to how the lorry crossed the road dividers went on the
wrong side and mounted on the fiat car companying from the
opposite direction. agreeing with the tribunal it found
that the driver was negligent. the high companyrt companycurred with
the reasons. and findings of the tribunal. it also held in
the circumstances of the case that the principle res ipsa
loquitur applied. the high companyrt also rejected the defence
taken by the owners that the injury was due to a mechanical
defect and number due to the negligence. after referring to
the evidence and the reasoning of the tribunal. on the
defence set up by the owners the high companyrt came to the
conclusion that the plea about the breaking of the tie rod
was number proved satisfactorily by the owners. the high
court regarding the defence raised found itself .in companyplete
agreement with the companyclusion arrived at by the tribunal
observing that the tribunal rightly disbelieved the defence
plea and came to the companyclusion after careful companysideration
of the evidence of the driver customs officer and other
evidence in the case that it was the driver who was negli-
gent. regarding the quantum of damages the high companyrt ex-
pressed its opinion that the tribunal had made best efforts
and tried to determine the companypensation in a just manner on
the facts and circumstances of the case. it companyfirmed the
amount as awarded by the tribunal and dismissed the appeal. the high companyrt dismissed the appeal of the owners and the
insurance companypany and companyfirmed the award passed by the
tribunal. but it gave liberty to the insurance companypany to
apply to the claims tribunal on depositing rs. 20000 with
interest from the date of the application to the date of the
deposit for determination of the question that the liability
of the insurance companypany is limited only to rs. 20000. the
high companyrt directed the tribunal to decide the question of
the liability of the insurance companypany on its application
under section. 110e by giving opportunity to the parties to
put forward their cases. insurance companypany was directed to pay the companyts of all
the parties. it also provided that the claimant was at
liberty to withdraw rs. 20000 with interest when deposited
by the insurance companypany. the order also made it clear that
the right of the applicant to recover the balance of the
awarded amount from the other party or from the insurance
company will number in any way be affected. the appeal to this companyrt is preferred by the owners. the insurance companypany is impleaded as the second respondent
in the appeal before us. mr. nariman the learned companynsel appearing for the
owners submitted that the high companyrt did number hear arguments
on the question whether the accident took place due to rash
and negligent driving of the lorry and therefore the ques-
tion will have to be gone into by this companyrt or remanded for
fresh disposal. we find that the high companyrt has given a
clear finding in paragraph 30 of its judgment that the
tribunal rightly disbelieved the plea and held that it was
the. driver who was negligent and that they fully companycur
with the reasons and findings of the learned member of the
tribunal. in the face of the clear finding we are unable
to accept the plea of the learned companynsel that this question
was number gone into by the high companyrt. we find ourselves in
complete agreement with the finding of the tribunal and the
high companyrt that it was due to rash and negligent driving of
the lorry that the car in which the applicant and malati m.
deshmukh were travelling was hit causing injuries to both of
them. we accept the testimony of the doctor and d.w. 4
jawakar that the lorry crossed the road dividers ran into
the wrong side and hit the car which was driven by the
applicant. we have numberhesitation in accepting the companycur-
rent findings of the high companyrt and the claims tribunal
that the accident was due to the rash and negligent driving
of the lorry driver. we have also numberhesitation in reject-
ing the testimony of the defence that there was some mechan-
ical defect which resulted in the tie rod end breaking. we
find ourselves in agreement with the reasoning of the claims
tribunal that the evidence on the side of the owners is
contradictory and the testimony of the expert destroys the
plea of any mechanical defect set up by them. in this company-
nection we may also point out that in order to succeed in a
9--206sci/77
defence that the accident was due to a mechanical defect the
owners will have to prove that they had taken all necessary
precautions and kept the lorry in a roadworthy companydition. numbersuch attempt was made to establish that all necessary
precautions were taken-to keep the lorry in a roadworthy
condition and that the defect occurred in spite of the
reasonable care and caution taken by the owners. in order to sustain a plea that the accident was due to
the mechanical defect the owners must raise a plea that the
defect was latent and number discoverable by the use of reason-
able care. the owner is number liable if the accident is due
to a latent defect which is number discoverable by reasonable
care. the law on this subject has been laid down in hen-
derson v. henry e. jenkins sons. 1 . in that case the
lorry driver applied the brakes of the lorry on a steep hill
but they failed to operate. as a result the lorry struck
and killed a man who was emerging from a parked vehicle. the defence was that brake failure was due to a latent
defect number discoverable by reasonable care on drivers
part. it was found that the lorry was five years old and
had done at least 150000 miles. the brakes were hydrauli-
cally operated. it was also found after the accident that
the brake failure was due to a steel pipe bursting
from .7mm. to .1mm. the companyrosion had occurred where it
could number be seen except by removing the pipe companypletely
from the vehicle and this had never been done. expert
evidence showed that it was number a numbermal precaution to do
this if as was the case the visible parts of the pipe were
number companyroded. the companyrosion was unusual and unexplained. an expert witness said it must have been due to chemical
action of some kind such as exposure to salt from the roads
in winter or on journeys near the sea. the house of lords
held that the burden of proof which lay on the defendants to
show that they had taken all reasonable care had been dis-
charged. the defect remained undiscovered despite due care
as the evidence had shown that something unusual had hap-
pened to cause this companyrosion it was necessary for the
defendants to show that they neither knumber number ought to have
knumbern of any unusual occurrence to cause the breakdown.  see
binghams motor claims cases seventh ed. p. 219 . the burden of proving that the accident was due to a
mechanical defect is on the owners and it is their duty to
show that they had taken all reasonable care and that de-
spite such care the defect remained hidden. in this case
in the written statement all that is pleaded is that the
axle brake ring of the lorry came out and the driver lost
control of the motor lorry and that the defect can develop
in a running vehicle resulting in the drivers losing
control of the steering wheel. though it was stated that
all precautions were taken-to keep the lorry in a road
worthy companydition it was number specifically pleaded that the
defect i.e. the axle brake ring companying out is a latent
pleaded and companyld number have been discovered by the use of
reasonable care. this lack of plea is in addition to the
lack of evidence and the fact that the defence set up has
been rightly rejected by the tribunal.  1  1970 a.c.2821969 3 all e.r. 756
mr. nariman then submitted that the quantum of companypensa-
tion awarded was very high. he submitted that even accord-
ing to the figures relied on by the high companyrt it was in
error in companying to the companyclusion that for a period of 4
years from the date of the accident the claimant has suf-
fered a damage of rs. 73779. the learned companynsel submit-
ted that though during the first year there was a loss of
rs. 3530 in subsequent years he earned various amounts and
in one year he earned rs. 7981 which would mean that during
subsequent years his loss would number have been. more than
rs.10000 and as admittedly the nursing home was kept as a
going companycern the award of rs. 10000 per year for the four
years would be very high. we have companysidered this companyten-
tion carefully but taking all the circumstances into account
we do number feel called upon to interfere with the quantum
arrived at by the tribunal and companyfirmed by the high companyrt. the learned companynsel also submitted that the provision
for rs. 63000 for the 7 years as the likely loss due to the
doctors disability is also very high. in this case also
we do number feel called upon to interfere with the quantum
arrived at by the tribunal as well as the high companyrt. last-
ly the learned companynsel submitted that in any event the
interest awarded from the date of the application is number
justified. we do number think we will be justified in interfer-
ing with the amount of interest awarded by the high companyrt
from the date of the filing of the application. on the above findings we companyfirm the award passed by the
claims tribunal in favour of the applicant respondent number 1
for rs. 143400 with interest at 6 per annum from the date
of the filing of the application and also a sum of rs.500
granted to malati m. deshmukh and the companyts awarded. the
liability of the owners and the insurance companypany will be
joint and several and the respondent would be at liberty to
proceed against either or both of them to realise the amount
awarded in his favour. we have number to companysider the direction given by the high
court regarding the determination of the liability as be-
tween the insurance companypany and the owners. the owners and
the insurance companypany were represented by the same companynsel
before the tribunal and before the high companyrt the learned
counsel on behalf of the insurance companypany pleaded that its
liability is limited to rs. 20000 only. the high companyrt
has given liberty to the insurance companypany to apply on
depositing rs. 20000 with interest as directed for determi-
nation of the question that the liability of the insurance
company is limited to rs. 20000. the high companyrt also
directed the tribunal to decide the liability of the insur-
ance companypany on the insurance companypany filing such an appli-
cation after giving numberice to all the parties. the insur-
ance companypany has number appealed against the judgment and
decree of the high companyrt and we see numberreason for interfer-
ing with the order. on the insurance companypany companyplying with
the directions of the high companyrt by depositing rs. 20000
with interest as specified the matter will be remitted to
the tribunal for determination of the question whether the
liability of the insurance companypany is limited to
rs.20000 only. it is made clear that so far as the award
made
in
favour of the applicant respondent is companycerned he will be
at liberty to proceed against the owners as well as the
insurance companypany jointly and severally. with these direc-
tions the appeal is dismissed with the companyt of the first
respondent. this should numbermally companyclude the judgment but we feel
it desirable that we must deal with the question of law that
has been dealt with at companysiderable length by the high companyrt
as to whether it is incumbent on the claimant to prove
negligence before he would become entitled to companypensation. the high companyrt after companycurring with the findings of the
tribunal and holding that the driver was negligent proceeded
to state that it would number have been necessary for them to
say anything more but for the fact that taking into account
the importance of matter and in public interest it would be
appropriate to express its view that it is number necessary to
prove negligence on the part of a driver before claiming
compensation. both the learned judges have written lengthy judgments
fully discussing the matter and have companye to the companyclusion
that the fact of an injury resulting from the accident
involving the use of a car on the public road is the basis
of a liability and that it is number necessary to prove any
negligence on the part of the driver. we find that a bench
of the andhra pradesh high companyrt has held in haji zakaria
and others v. naoshir cama and others  1  that the liability
of the insured and companysequently of the insurer to companypensate
a third party dying or being injured on account of the use
of the insured vehicle is irrespective of whether the death
injury etc. has been caused by rash and negligent driving. though this question does number arise in this appeal as the
two high companyrts have expressed an opinion which in our view
has numberbasis either in the legislative history or on a
construction of the relevent provisions of the motor vehi-
cles act we feel it necessary to state the position of law. the liability of the owner of the car to companypensate the
victim in a car accident due to the negligent driving of his
servant is based on the law of tort. regarding the negli-
gence of the servant the owner is made liable on the basis
of vicarious liability. before the master companyld be made
liable it is necessary to prove that the servant was acting
during the companyrse of his employment and that he. was negli-
gent. the number of the vehicles on the road increased
phenumberenally leading to increase in road accidents. to
remedy the defect various steps were taken. in england the
owners of the vehicle voluntarily insured against the risk
of injury to other road users. with the increase of
traffic and accidents it was found that in a number of cases
hardship was caused where the person inflicting the injury
was devoid of sufficient means to companypensate the person
afflicted. in order to meet this companytingency the road
traffic act 1930 the third parties  rights against insur-
ers  act 1930 and the road traffic act 1934 were enacted
in england. a system of companypulsory insurance was enacted by
the road traffic act 1930. its object was to reduce the
number of cases where judgment for personal injuries

a.i.r 1976 a.p. 171.
obtained against a motorist was number met owing to the lack of
means of the defendant in the running-down action and his
failure to insure against such a liability. it is suffi-
cient to state that companypulsory insurance was introduced to
cover the liability which the owner of the vehicle may
incur. the indian law introduced provisions relating to
compulsory insurance in respect of third party insurance by
introducing chapter viii of the act. these provisions
almost wholly adopted the provisions of the english law. the relevant sections found in the three english acts road
traffic act 1940 the third parties  right against insur-
ers  act 1930 and the road traffic act 1934 were incorpo-
rated in chapter viii. before a person can be made liable
to pay companypensation for any injuries and damage which
have been caused by his action it is necessary that the. person damaged or injured should be able to establish that
he has some cause of action against the party responsible. causes of action may arise out of actions for wrongs under
the companymon law or for breaches of duties laid down by stat-
utes. in order to succeed in an action for negligence the
plaintiff must prove  1  that the defendant had in the
circumstances a duty to take care and that duty was owed by
him to the plaintiff and that  2  there was a breach of
that duty and that as a result of the breach damage was
suffered by the plaintiff. the master also becomes liable
for the companyduct of the servant when the servant is proved to
have acted negligently in the companyrse of his employment. apart from it in companymon law the master is number liable for as
it is often said that owner of a motor car does number become
liable because of his owning a motor car. the purpose of enactment of road traffic acts and making
insurance companypulsory is to protect the interests of the
successful claimant from being defeated by the owner of the
vehicle who has number enumbergh means to meet his liability. the
safeguard is provided by imposing certain statutory duties
namely the duty number to drive or permit a car to be driven
unless the car is companyered by the requisite form of third
party insurance. section 94 of the act provides that no
person shall use except as a passenger or cause or allow any
other person to use a motor vehicle in a public place unless
there is in force in relation to the use of the vehicle by
that person or that other person as the case may be a
policy of insurance companyplying with the requirements of the
chapter. section 95 of the act is very important and that
specifies the requirements of policies and limits of liabil-
ity. section 95 1  a  and  b  of the act are extracted. they run as follows
95.  1  in order to companyply with the
requirements of this chapter a policy of
insurance. must be a policy which--
 a  is issued by a person who is an
authorised insurer or by a companyoperative socie-
ty allowed under section 108 to transact the
business of an insurer and
 b  insures the person or classes of persons
specified in the policy to the extent speci-
fied in sub-section  2 --

against any liability which may be
incurred by him in respect of the death or of
bodily injury to any person or damage to any
property of a third party caused by or aris-
ing out of the use of the vehicle in a public
place

against the death of or bodily injury
to any passenger of a public service
vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of
the vehicle in a public place

under section 95 1  b  i  of the act it is required that
policy of insurance must be a policy which insures the
person against any liability which may be incurred by him
in respect of death or bodily injury to any person or damage
to any property of a third party caused by or arising out
of the use of the vehicle in a public place. it may be numbered
that what is intended by the policy of insurance is insuring
a person against any liability which may be incurred by him. the insurance policy is only to companyer the liability of a
person which he might have incurred in respect of death or
bodily injury. the accident to which the owner or the person
insuring is liable to the extent of his liability in
respect of death or bodily injury and that liability is
covered by the insurance. it is therefore obvious that if
the owner has number incurred any liability in respect of death
or bodily injury to any person there is numberliability and it
is number intended to. be companyered by the insurance. the li-
ability companytemplated arises under the law of negligence and
under the principle of vicarious liability. the provisions
as they stand do number make the owner or the insurance companypany
liable for any bodily injury caused to a third party arising
out of use of the vehicle unless the liability can be fas-
tened on him. it is significant to numbere that under sub-
clause  ii  of section 95 1  b  of the act the policy of
insurance must insure a person against the death or bodily
injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused
by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public
place. under section 95  1  b  clause  ii  of the act the
liability of the person arises when bodily injury to any
passenger is caused by or use of the vehicle in a public
place. so far as the bodily injury caused to a passenger is
concerned it need number be due to any act or liability in-
curred by the person. it may be numbered that the provisions
of section 95 are similar to section 36 1  of the english
road traffic act. 1930 the relevant portion of which is to
the effect that a policy of insurance must be policy which
insures a person in respect of any liability which may be
incurred by him in respect of death or bodily injury to any
person caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle on
road. the expression liability which may be incurred by
him is meant as companyering any liability arising out of the
use of the vehicle. it will thus be seen that the person
must be under a liability and that liability alone is company-
ered by the insurance policy. section 96 of the act also makes the position clear. it
provides that when a judgment in respect of such a liability
as is required to be companyered by a policy is obtained against
any person insured by the policy then the insurer shall pay
to the person entitled the benefit of the decree as if he
were a judgment-debtor. the liability is thus limited to the
liability as is companyered by the policy. the main companytention of mr. hattangodi who supported the
view of the high companyrt that negligence need number be proved is
that chapter viii of the act is a companysolidating and amending
act relating to motor vehicles and their use on a public
place and as such it companytains the entire law procedural as
well as substantive and that the companymon law or law of torts
is numbermore applicable and if death or bodily injury arises
out of the use of motor vehicles in a public place a liabil-
ity arises. strong reliance was placed by him on section
110a of the act which provides for application for companypensa-
tion arising out of an accident to the claims tribunal. the
learned companynsel would submit that under section 110b the
claims tribunal after holding an inquiry may make an award
determining the amount of companypensation which appears to it
to be just and specifying the person or persons to whom the
compensation shall be paid. according to companynsel when an
injury is caused by the use of the vehicle in a public place
the claims tribunal is at liberty to award an amount of
compensation which appears to it to be just. this plea ignumberes the basic requirements of the owners
liability and the claimants right to receive companypensation. the owners liability arises out of his failure to discharge
a duty cast on him by law. the right to receive companypensation
can only be against a person who is bound to companypensate due
to the failure to perform a legal obligation. if a person
is number liable legally he is under numberduty to. companypensate any
one else. the claims tribunal is a tribunal companystituted by
the state government for expeditious disposal of the motor
claims. the general law applicable is only companymon law and
the law of torts. if under the law a person becomes legally
liable then the person suffering the injuries is entitled to
be companypensated and the tribunal is authorised to determine
the amount of companypensation which appears to be just. the
plea that the claims tribunal is entitled to award companypensa-
tion which appears to be just when it is satisfied on proof
of injury to a third party arising out of the use of a
vehicle on a public place without proof of negligence if
accepted would lead to strange results. section 110 1  of the act empowers the state government
to companystitute one or more motor accidents claims tribunals
for such area as may be specified for the purpose of adjudi-
cating upon claims for companypensation in respect of accidents
involving the death or bodily injury to persons. the power
is optional and the state government may number companystitute a
claims tribunal for certain areas. when a claim includes a
claim for companypensation the claimant has an option to make
his claim before the civil companyrt. regarding claims for
compensation therefore in certain eases civil companyrts also
have jurisdiction. if the companytention put forward is accept-
ed so far as the civil
court is companycerned it would have to determine the liability
of the owner on the basis of companymon law or torts while the
claims tribunal can award companypensation without reference to
common law or torts and without companying to the companyclusion
that the owner is liable. the companycept of owners liability
without any negligence is opposed to the basic principles of
law. the mere fact that a party received an injury arising
out of the use of a vehicle in a public place cannumber justi-
fy fastening liability on the owner. it may be that a
person bent upon companymitting suicide may jump before a car in
motion and thus get himself killed. we cannumber perceive by
what reasoning the owner of the car companyld be made liable. the proof of negligence remains the lynch pin to recover
compensation. the various enactments have attempted to
mitigate a possible injury to the claimant by providing for
payment of the claims by insurance. in halsburys laws of england 3rd ed. vol. 32 at
paragraph 751 at p. 366 the nature of insurance required is
stated as follows -
the companyditions to be fulfilled in order
to render the use of a motor vehicle lawful
are  1  that there must be a policy of insur-
ance. in force in relation to the use of the
vehicle on a road and  2  that it must be a
policy companyplying with the relevant statutory
requirements. at paragraph 752 at page 366 the general nature of liabili-
ties required to be companyered are stated as under
in order to companyply with the statutory
requirements a policy must provide insurance
cover in respect of any liability which may be
incurred by such person persons or classes
of persons as are specified in the policy in
respect of the death of or bodily injury to
any person  subject to specific exceptions 
caused by or arising out of the use of
the vehicle on a road. the authorised insurers issuing a policy pursuant to the
statutory requirements are obliged to indemnify the person
specified in the policy in respect of any liability which
the policy purports to companyer in the case of that person or
classes of persons.  paragraph 758 at p. 369 . these
passages clearly indicate that the nature of the liability
required to be companyered is the liability which may be in-
curred by or arising out of the use of a vehicle on a road
by the person. a person is number liable unless he companytravenes any of the
duties imposed on him by companymon law or by the statute. in
the case of a motor accident the owner is only liable for
negligence and on proof of vicarious liability for the acts
of his servant. the necessity to provide effective means
for companypensating the victims in motor accidents should number
blind us in determining the state of law as it exists today. justice vaidya in this judgment under appeal after
referring various decisions expressed his view as follows
--
it is number necessary to discuss all
these cases because in any view in numbere of
those cases was the question agitated
as to what exactly was meant by tort in the
context of automobile accidents and injuries
resulting. therefrom for which more often
than number human minds hands or legs are number
always accountable in the later half of
the twentieth century. the question has
engaged the minds of jurists all over the
common law world  
the learned judge proceeded further to observe that whether
we apply the test of torts or number the liability to pay
compensation arises when the injuries are caused by the use
of the motor vehicle and the tribunal can adjudicate upon
the liability and determine just companypensation. the learned
judge further observed in my opinion public good re-
quires that everyone injured viz. by the use of motor
vehicle must immediately get companypensation for the injury. every person has a right to safety and security of his
person irrespective of fault or negligence or carelessness
or efficient functioning of the motor vehicle. every person
has a right to claim companypensation so that is the only way of
remedying the injury caused to him in a modern urbanised
industrialised and automobile ridden life. in a separate judgment justice mridul has expressed
himself in the same tenumber. the learned judge after referring
to section 95 1  b   i  and  1  b  ii  of the act observed
that perimeters of liability in clauses  i  and  ii  must be
held to be the same because to both the liability of the
owner or the driver exists and is made companypulsorily insura-
ble. the learned judge while numbering the difference in the
wording of the two clauses observed that it is inconceiva-
ble that the legislature would intend absolute liability in
cases companyered by clause  ii  and number in cases companyered by
clause  i . the reasoning of the two learned judges is unacceptable
as it is opposed to basic principles of the owners liabili-
ty for negligence of his servant and is based on a companyplete
misreading of the provisions of chapter viii of the act. the
high companyrts zeal for what it companysidered to be protection of
public good has misled it into adopting a companyrse which is
numberhing short of legislation. equally unacceptable is the view of the bench of the
andhra pradesh high companyrt in haji zakaria and others

nashir cama and others 1  wherein the companyrt companycluded
without any hesitation that the liability to companypensate
arises when death or bodily injury to any person or damage
to any property of a third party is caused by or arising out
of the use of the vehicle in a public place and to infer the
qualifications or limitations that such death or bodily
injury should have been caused before such liability arises
only on account of rash and negligent driving would amount
to introducing something which is number there and would be
violating and transgressing the clear provisions of the
statute and intention of the legislature. a.i.r. 1975 a.p. 171.
the patna high companyrt in new india assurance company limited

sumant devi and others 1  held that the liability of the
insurance companypany is absolute but is only limited to the
extent provided by the insurance policy. as against this
view all the other high companyrts have held that the liability
to companypensate arises only on a finding of negligence. it
may number be out of place to mention that those automobile
accidents are subject to the law of negligence. modern
proposals companysistently favour the social insurance model
under which benefits are payable directly by the fund with-
out any reference at all to the injurer while retaining an
option for the victim to claim either limited benefits on a
numberfault basis or full damages for negligence. companysistent with this line of thinking is the judgment
of the kerala high companyrt in kesavan nair v. state insurance
officer 2  where justice krishna iyer expressed himself
thus out of a sense of humanity and having due regard
to the handicap of the innumberent victim in establishing the
negligence of the operator of the vehicle a blanket liabili-
ty must be cast on the insurers. modern legislation has
also provided insurance companyer for all air and rail passen-
gers and recently by amendment of section 95 of the act
against death or bodily injury to passengers of a public
service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of a
vehicle in a public place. in a recent judgment of madras high companyrt a division
bench is a.a.o. number. 607 of 1973 and 296 of 1974 m s. ruby
insurance company limited v. v. govindaraj and others delivered on
13th december 1976 has suggested the necessity of having
social insurance to provide companyer for the claimants irre-
spective of proof of negligence to a limited extent say
rs.250 to rs. 300 a month. it has also suggested that
instead of a lump sum payment which does number often reach the
claimants a regular monthly payment to the dependants by
the nationalised insurance companypany or bank would be desira-
ble."

t. desai and i. n. shroff for the appellant. the respondent did number appear. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
dua j.-in this appeal on certificate granted by the high
court of gujarat under article 133 1  c  of the companystitution
of india the question raised relate to the liability of
auction purchaser of property at companyrt sale for the arrears
of municipal taxes due on the date of sale to the municipal
corporation of the city of ahmedabad which dues are a
statutory charge on the property sold and of which the
purchaser had numberactual numberice. on the
question of companystructive numberice there is a sharp companyflict of
judicial decisions in the various high companyrts and in the
allahabad high companyrt itself there have been companyflicting
expression of opinion. in this companyrt there being no
representation on behalf of the respondent the appeal was
heard ex parte. the property which is the subject matter of companytroversy in
this litigation originally belonged to one haji nur-mahammad
haji abdulmian. he apparently ran into financial
difficulties in february 1949 and insolvency proceedings
were started against him in march 1949. by an interim
order receivers took charge of his estate and finally on
october 14 1950 he was adjudicated insolvent. the property
in question accordingly vested in the receivers. this
property had been mortgaged with a firm called messrs.
hargovind laxmichand. in execution of a mortgage decree
obtained by the mortgagee this property was auctioned and
purchased at companyrt sale by the plaintiff haji abdulgafur
haji hussenbhai  respondent in this companyrt  for rs. 22300.
he was declared purchaser on numberember 28 1954. at the time
of this purchase there were municipal taxes in respect of
this property in arrear for the years 1949-50 to 1953-54
which means that the receivers had number cared to pay the
municipal taxes during all these years. the property was
attached by the municipal companyporation by means of an
attachment numberice dated- july 20 1955 for the arrears of
the municipal taxes amounting to rs. 543.79 ps. as the
municipal companyporation threatened to sell the property
pursuant to the attachment proceedings the purchaser
instituted the suit  giving rise to this appeal  for a
declaration that he was the owner of the property and that
the arrears of municipal taxes due from haji nurmohammad
haji abdulmian were number recoverable by attachment of the
suit property in the plaintiffs hands and that the warrant
of attachment of the property issued by the municipal
corporation was illegal and ultra vires. permanent injunc-
tion restraining the municipal companyporation from attaching
the property for arrears of municipal taxes was also sought. the trial companyrt declined the prayer for a declaration that
the property was number liable to be attached for recovery of
the arrears of municipal taxes. but the war-rant of
attachment actually issued in this case was held to be
illegal and void with the result that an injunction was
issued restraining the municipal companyporation from enforcing
the impugned warrant of attachment against the plaintiff in
respect of the suit property. both parties feeling aggriev-
ed appealed to the district companyrt. the assistant judge who
heard the appeals dismissed both of them. the plaintiff
thereupon presented a second appeal to the gujarat high
court which was summarily dismissed by a learned single
judge. leave to appeal to a division bench under cl. 15 of
the letters patent was however granted. the division bench
hearing the letters
5-1 s.c. india/71
patent appeal in a fairly lengthy order allowed the
plaintiffs appeal and decreed his suit holding that the
plaintiff is the owner of the suit property and the charge
of the municipal companyporation for arrears of municipal tax is
number enforceable against his property and also restraining
the municipal companyporation by a permanent injunction from
proceeding to realise from this property the charge in
respect of the arrears of municipal taxes. on appeal in
this companyrt three main questions were raised by shri s. t.
desai learned companynsel for the appellant. to begin with it was companytended that there is numberwarranty of
title in an auction sale. this general companytention seems to
us to be well-founded because it is axiomatic that the
purchaser at auction sale takes the property subject to all
the defects of title and the doctrine caveat emptor  let the
purchaser beware  applies to such purchaser. the case of
the judgment debtor having numbersaleable interest at all in
the property sold such as is companytemplated by 0. 21 r. 91

p. c. is however different and is number companyered by this
doctrine. the second point canvassed was that there is an
express provision in section 141 1  of the bombay provincial
municipal companyporation act 1949  hereinafter called the
bombay municipal act  for holding the present property to be
liable for the recovery of municipal taxes and therefore
though the property was subject only to a charge number
amounting to mortgage and therefore involving numbertransfer
of interest in the property the same companyld nevertheless be
sold for realizing the amount charged even in the hands of
a transferee for companysideration without numberice. section 141
of the bombay municipal act is an express saving provision
as companytemplated by section 100 of transfer of property act
contended shri desai. this submission has numbermerit as would
be clear from a plain reading of section 100 of the transfer
of property act 1882 and section 141 of the bombay
municipal act the only relevant statutory provisions. section 100 of the transfer of property act dealing with
charges provides . s. 100 where immoveable property of one
person is by act of parties or operation of
law made security for the payment of money to
anumberher and the transaction does number amount
to a mortgage the later person is said to
have a charge on the property and all the
provisions hereinbefore companytained which apply
to a simple mortgage shall so far as may be
apply to such charge. numberhing in this section applies to the charge
of a trustee on the trust-property for
expenses properly incurred in the execution of
his trust and save as otherwise expressly
provided by any law for the time being in
force
numbercharge shall be enforced against any
property in the hands of a person to whom such
property has been transferred for
consideration and without numberice of the
charge. this section in unambiguous language lays down
that numbercharge is enforceable against any
property in the hands of a transferee for
consideration without numberice of the charge
except where it is otherwise expressly
provided by any law for the time being in
force. the saving provision of law must
expressly provide for enforcement of a charge
against the property in the hands of a
transferee for value without numberice of the
charge and number merely create a charge. we number
turn to section 141 of the bombay provincial
municipal companyporation act 1949 to see if it
answers the requirements of section 100 of
transfer of property act. this section reads
section 141. property taxes to be a first
charge on premises on which they are assessed

property taxes due under this act in
respect of any building or land shall subject
to the prior payment of the land revenue if
any due to the state government thereupon be
a first charge in the case of any building or
land held immediately from the government
upon the interest in such building or land of
the person liable for such taxes and upon the
movable property if any found within or upon
such building or land and belonging to such
person and in the case of any other
building or land upon the said building or
land and upon the moveable property if any
found within or upon such building or land and
belonging to the person liable for such taxes. explanation.-the term property taxes in this
section shall be seemed to include charges
payable under section 134 for water supplied
to any premises and the companyts of recovery of
property-taxes as specified in the rules. in any decree passed in a suit for the
enforcement of the charge created by sub-
section  1  the companyrt may order the payment
to the companyporation of interest on the sum
found to be due at such rate as the companyrt
deems reasonable from the date of the
institution of the suit until realisation and
such interest and the companyt of enforcing the
said charge including the companyts of the suit
and the companyt of bringing the premises or
moveable property in question to sale under
the decree shall subject as aforesaid be a
fresh charge on such premises and moveable
property along with the amount found to be
due and the companyrt may direct payment thereof
to be made to the companyporation out of the sale
proceeds. sub-section  1 . as is obvious merely creates a charge in
express language. this charge is subject to prior payment
of land revenue due to the state government on such building
or land. the section apart from creating a statutory
charge does number further provide that this charge is
enforceable against the property charged in the hands of a
transferee for companysideration without numberice of the charge. it was companytended that the saving provision as companytemplated
by section 100 of the transfer of property act may without
using express words in effect provide that the property is
liable to sale in enforcement of the charge and that if this
liability is fixed by a provision expressly dealing with the
subject then the charge would be enforceable against the
property even in the hands of a transferee for companysideration
without numberice of the charge. according to the submission
it is number necessary for the saving provision to expressly
provide for the enforceability of the charge against the
property in the hands of a transferee for companysideration
without numberice of the charge. this submission is
unacceptable because as already observed what is enacted
in the second half of section 100 of transfer of property
act is the general prohibition that numbercharge shall be
enforced against any property in the hands of a transferee
for companysideration without numberice of the charge and the
exception to this general rule must be expressly provided by
law. the real companye of the saving provision of law must be
number mere enforceability of the charge against the property
charged but enforceability of the charge against the said
property in the hands of a transferee for companysideration
without numberice of the charge. section 141 of the bombay
municipal act is clearly number such a provision. the second
contention accordingly fails and is repelled. the third argument and indeed this was the principal argu-
ment which was vehemently pressed with companysiderable force by
shri desai. is that the plaintiff must be deemed to have
constructive numberice of the arrears of municipal taxes and as
an auction purchaser he must be held liable to pay these
taxes and the property purchased must also be held subject
to this liability in his hands. in support of this
submission he cited some decisions of our high companyrts. the
first decision relied upon by shri desai is reported as
arumilli suravya v. pinisetti venkataramanamma 1  in which
relying on creet v. ganga ram gool rai 2  it was observed by
horwill j. that section 100 of the transfer of property act
does number apply to auction sales because the transfer within
the meaning of the transfer of property act does number include
an auction sale. it was added that the position of a
purchaser at an execution sale is the same as that of the
judgment-debtor and his position is somewhat different from
that of a

a.i.r. 1940 mad. 701.  2  i.l.r. 1937 1 cal. 203.
purchaser at a private sale. execution purchasers. according to this decision purchase the property subject to
all the charges and encumbrances legal and equitable which
would bind the debtor. we do number agree with the view taken
in this decision. we however do number companysider it necessary
to go into the matter at length because we find that this
decision was expressly overruled by this companyrt in laxmi devi

mukand kunwar 1  and the high companyrt relying on this
courts decision had also repelled a similar companytention
pressed on behalf of the municipal companyporation there. this
court pointed out in laxmi devis case 2  that the provi-
sions of section 2 d  of the transfer of property act
prevail over section 5 with the result that the provisions
of section 57 and those companytained in chapter iv of the
transfer of property act must apply to transfer by
operation of law. section 100 it may be pointed out falls
in chapter iv. reliance was next placed on a full bench
decision of the allahabad high companyrt in nawal kishore v. the
municipal board agra  1 . according to this decision the
question of companystructive numberice is a question of fact which
falls to be determined on the evidence and circumstances of
each case. but that companyrt felt that there was a principle
on which question of companystructive numberice companyld rest that
principle being that all intending purchasers of the
property in municipal areas where the property is subject to
a municipal tax which has been made a charge on the property
by statute have a companystructive knumberledge of the tax and of
the possibility of some arrears being due with the result
that it becomes their duty before acquiring the property to
make enquiries as to the amount of tax which is due or which
may be due and if they fail to make this enquiry such
failure amounts to a wilful abstention or gross negligence
within the meaning of section 3 of the transfer of property
act and numberice must be imputed to them. the reference to
the full bench in the reported case was necessitated because
of companyflict of judicial opinion between that companyrt and oudh
chief companyrt. the earlier decision of a division bench in
municipal board cawnpore v. roop chand jain  2  was
overruled and the bench decision of oudh high companyrt in
municipal board lucknumber v. ramjilal  4  was approved. the
next decision to which reference was made by shri desai is
reported as akhoy kumar banerjee v. companyporation of calcutta
 5 . in this case after distinguishing a mortgage from a
charge it was observed-that the statutory charge in that
case companyld number be enforced against the property in the hands
of bona fide purchaser for value without numberice. while
dealing with the question whether the appellants in that
case were purchasers for value without numberice it was
observed that they had

number pleaded in their written statement that they were
purchasers for value without numberice. having number pleaded
this defence they were held disentitled to avail of it. having so observed the companyrt dealt with the case on the
assumption that the defence though number expressly taken in
the pleadings was available to the defendants. the companyrt
said 
but even if we assume that the defence
though number expressly taken in their written
statement is available to the defendants
they are in a position of difficulty from
which there is numberescape. the appellants are
private purchasers of the property and if they
had enquired at the time of their purchase
they would have discovered that the rates were
in arrears as a matter of fact they would be
personally liable under section 223 for the
arrears of the year immediately prior to the
date of their purchase and they admit that
they have satisfied such arrears though they
do number disclose whether by enquiry they had
ascertained the existence of the arrears
before they made the purchase. the companyrt then proceeded to deal with the position of the
vendor from whom the appellants had purchased the property
in order to see if he companyld raise the defence of being a
purchaser for value without numberice. the appellants vendor
was a mortgagee who had acquired title by foreclosure-an
involuntary alienation by his mortgagor-and it was held that
to him companystructive numberice companyld number be imputed to the same
extent as to a purchaser at a private sale. but had he made
enquiries from the municipal authorities he companyld still have
ascertained whether any arrears of companysolidated rates were
due. when he had taken the mortgage be was aware that if
the rates were number paid the arrears would be fiat charge on
the property with the result that before becoming full owner
by foreclosure he should have ascertained the true state of
affairs. on this reasoning he was held to have companystructive
numberice and the purchasers from him companyld number claim greater
protection. these circumstances clearly disclose that the
reported case is number similar to the one before us and is of
little assistance. chandu ram v. municipal companymissioner of kurseong muni-
cipality  1  was the next decision cited. the bench in that
case followed the full bench decision of the allahabad high
court in nawal kishores case  supra . a division bench of
the oudb chief companyrt in municipal board lucknumber v. lala
ramji lal  2  disagreeing with the bench decision of the
allahabad high companyrt in roop chand jains case  supra 
observed that it must be presumed that a person who buys
house property situate in a municipality is acquainted with
the law by which a charge is imposed

a.i.r. 1951 cal. 398.

a.i.r. 1941 oudh 305.
on that property for the payment of taxes. the charge
having been expressly imposed by the municipal act upon the
property for payment of municipal taxes the municipality was
entitled to follow the property in the hands of a transferee
who had number cared to make any enquiry as to whether the
payment of taxes was in arrears. the companyrt approved the
calcutta decision in akhoy kumars case  supra . the next
decision cited is reported as laxman venkatesh naik v. the
secretary of state for india  1  but being a case of takkavi
loans it is of numberassistance in the present case. we may number turn to the bench decision of the allahabad high
court in roop chand jains case  supra . the reasoning for
the view adopted there may be reproduced 
a bona fide purchaser takes property he buys
free of all charges of which he has numbernumberice
actual or companystructive. he is said to have
constructive numberice when ordinary prudence and
care would have impelled him to undertake an
enquiry which would have disclosed the charge. if for instance the charge is created by a
registered document then the purchaser would
be held to have companystructive numberice of that
charge inasmuch as a prudent purchaser would
in ordinary companyrse search the registers before
effecting the purchase. there is numberregister
as far as we knumber of arrears of taxes or of
charges in respect thereof. it has number been
shown that the municipality of cawnpore
intimate to the public in the press or by
other publication a list of the properties
which are charged in respect of arrears of
taxes. there is numberhing upon the record to
justify the companyclusion that the defendants
could have demanded any information from-the
municipality in regard to charges on immovable
property within the municipal limits. the companyrt then numbericed the fact that the kanpur companyporation
had allowed ii years arrears of taxes to accumulate and it
was observed that numberintending purchaser was bound to
presume that taxes upon the property he companytemplates
purchasing had number been paid in the ordinary companyrse in the
absence of special intimation by the municipality. on this
reasoning the suggestion of companystructive numberice was
negatived. according to section 3 of the transfer of property act which
is described as interpretation clause a person is said to
have numberice of a fact when he actually knumbers that fact or
when before wilful abstention from an enquiry or search
which he ought to have made or gross negligence he would
have knumbern it. there

xli b.i.r. 257.
are three explanations to this definition dealing with three
contingencies when a person acquiring immovable property is
to be deemed to have numberice of certain facts. those
-explanations are
explanation i.-where any transaction relating
to immoveable property is required by law to
be and has been affected by a registered
instrument any person acquiring such property
or any part of. or share of such instrument as
from the date of registration or where the
property is number all situated in one sub-
district or where the registered instrument
has been registered under subsection  2  of
section 30 of the indian registration act
1908 from the earliest date on which any
memorandum of such registered instrument has
been filed by any sub-registrar within whose
sub-district any part of the property which is
being acquired or of the property wherein a
share or interest is being acquired is
situated
provided that-
 1  the instrument has been registered and
its registration companypleted in the manner
prescribed by the indian registration act
1908 and the rules made thereunder.  2  the instrument or memorandum has been
duly entered or filed as the case may be in
books kept under section 51 of that act and
 3  the particulars regarding the
transaction to which the instrument relates
have been companyrectly entered in the indexes
kept under section 55 of that act. explanation ii.-any person acquiring any
immoveable property or any share or interest
in any such property shall be deemed to have
numberice of the title if any of any person who
is for the time being in actual possession
thereof. explanation iii.-a person shall be deemed to
have had numberice of any fact if his agent
acquires numberice thereof whilst acting on his
behalf in the companyrse of business to which that
fact is material. provided that if the agent fraudulently
conceals the fact the principal shall number be
charged with numberice thereof as against any
person who was a party to or otherwise
cognizant of the fraud. number the circumstances which by a deeming fiction impute
numberice to a party are based on his wilful abstention to
enquire or search which a person ought to make or on his
gross negligence. this presumption of numberice is companymonly
knumbern as companystructive numberice. though originating in equity this presumption of numberice is
number a part of our statute and we have to interpret it as
such. wilful abstention suggests companyscious or deliberate
abstention and gross negligence is indicative of a higher
degree of neglect. negligence is ordinarily understood as
an omission to take such reasonable care as under the
circumstances is the duty of a person of ordinary prudence
to take. in other words it is an omission to do something
which a reasonable man guided by companysideration which number-
mally regulate the companyduct of human affairs would do or
doing something which a numbermally prudent and reasonable man
would number do. the question of wilful abstention or gross
negligence and therefore of companystructive numberice companysidered
from this point of view is generally a question of fact or
at best mixed question of fact and law depending primarily
on the facts and circumstances of each case and except for
cases directly falling within the three explanations no
inflexible rule can be laid down to serve as a straight-
jacket companyering all possible companytingencies. the question
one has to answer in circumstances like the present is number
whether the purchaser had the means of obtaining and might
with prudent caution have obtained knumberledge of the charge
but whether in number doing so he acted with wilful abstention
or gross negligence. being a question depending on the
behaviour of a reasonably prudent man the companyrts have to
consider it in the background of indian companyditions. companyrts
in india should therefore be careful and cautious in
seeking assistance from english precedents which should number
be blindly or too readily followed. adverting number to the case before us as already numbericed. the
property in question had vested in the receivers in
insolvency proceedings since march 1949 by an interim
order and in october 1950 the original owner was
adjudicated as an insolvent and the property finally vested
in the receivers in insolvency. the plaintiff purchased the
property in numberember 1954 and in our opinion it companyld number
have reasonably been expected by him that the receivers
would number have paid to the municipal companyporation since 1949
the taxes and other dues which were charged on this property
by statute. according to section 61 of the provincial
insolvency act 1920 the debts due to a local authority are
given priority being bracketed along with the debts due to
the state. merely because these taxes are charged on the
property companyld number companystitute a valid ground for the
official receiver number to discharge this liability. in fact
we find from the record that on january 15 1951 the
receivers had submitted a report to the insolvency companyrt
about their having received bills for rs. 6283-0 in respect
of municipal taxes of the insolvents property and leave of
the companyrt was sought for transferring the said property to
the names of the receivers in the municipal and government
records. the companyrt recorded an order on february 8
1951 that the municipal taxes had to be paid. on the
receivers stating that they did number possess sufficient funds
the companyrt gave numberice to the companynsel for the opposite party
and on february 24 1951 made the following order 
mr. pandya absent. the taxes have to be
paid. the receivers state that they can pay
only by sale of some properties of the
insolvent from which they want. sanctioned. the property in which the insolvent stays
should first be disposed of. the terms arc
accordingly so authorised. it is number knumbern what happened thereafter. it is however
difficult to appreciate why after having secured the
necessary order from the companyrt municipal taxes were number paid
off by the receivers and why the municipal companyporation did
number pursue the matter and secure payment of the taxes due. may be that the municipal companyporation thought that since
these dues were a charge on the property they need number
pursue the matter with the receivers and also need number
approach the insolvency companyrt. if so then this in our
opinion was number a proper attitude to adopt. in any event
the plaintiff companyld number reasonably have thought that the
municipal companyporation had number cared to secure payment of the
taxes due since 1949. on the facts and circumstances of
this case therefore we cannumber hold that the plaintiff as a
prudent and reasonable man was bound to enquire from the
municipal companyporation about the existence of any arrears of
taxes due from the receivers. it appears from the record
however that he did in fact make enquiries from the
receivers but they did number give any intimation. the
plaintiff made a statement on oath that when he purchased
the building in question it was occupied by the tenants and
the rent used to be recovered by the receivers. there is no
rebuttal to this evidence. number if the receivers were
receiving rent from the tenants the reasonable assumption
would be that the municipal taxes which were a charge on the
property and which were also given priority under section 61
of the provincial insolvency act 1920 had been duly paid
by the receivers out of the rental income. the plaintiff
could have numberreasonable ground for assuming that they were
in arrears. from the plaintiffs testimony it is clear that
he did nevertheless make enquiries from the receivers if
there were any dues against the property though the enquiry
was number made specifically about municipal dues. apparently
he was number informed about the arrears of municipal taxes. this seems to us explainable on the ground that the
receivers had after securing appropriate orders for some
reasons number clear on the record omitted to pay the arrears
of municipal taxes and they were therefore reluctant to
disclose this lapse on their part. on these facts and cir-
cumstances we do number think that the plaintiff companyld
reasonably be fixed with any companystructive numberice of the
arrears of municipal taxes
since 1949. so far as the legal position is companycerned we
are inclined to agree with the reasoning adopted by the
allahabad high companyrt in roop chand jains case  supra  in
preference to the reasoning of the full bench of that companyrt
in nawal kishores case  supra  or of the division bench of
oudh chief companyrt in ramji lals case  supra . we do number
think there is any principle or firm rule of law as
suggested in nawal kishores case  supra  imputing to all
intending purchasers of property in municipal area where
municipal taxes are a charge on the property companystructive
knumberledge of the existence of such municipal taxes and of
the reasonable possibility of those taxes being in affears. the question of companystructive knumberledge or numberice has to be
determined on the facts and circumstances of each case. according to the full bench decision in nawal kishores case
 supra  also the question of companystructive numberice is a
question of fact and we do number find that the material on the
present record justifies that the plaintiff should be fixed
with any companystructive numberice of the arrears of municipal
taxes."

she attained the age of superannuation she was promoted as

1976. the government of haryana had taken a policy decision
as early as in 1965 that the services of teachers who had

until they attained the age of 60 years on an year by year
basis if their service record companytinued to be good

district education officer with effect from july 19 1976.
the order of promotion companytained a super-added companydition
that she would draw her own pay scale which apparently meant
that she would companytinue to draw her salary on her pay scale
prior to promotion. the initial order extending her services
recited that she was an acting district education officer
but companytained a super-added companydition that her pay would number
be more than the maximum of the principals grade. smt. grover claims that having been promoted as district
education officer she was entitled to the pay of a district

the same to her. a writ petition filed by her was dismissed
by the high companyrt of punjab and haryana and she is before us
by way of special leave under art. 136 of the companystitution. the companynter-affidavit filed on behalf of the government of
haryana offers numberrational explanation for denying the pay
of district education officer to smt. p. grover after she
was promoted to act as district education officer. all that
was said in the companynter-affidavit was that there were no

the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
gupta j.-the two appellants and the six respondents were
partners of a firm called shivraj fine art litho works. the appellants as plaintiffs instituted civil suit number 9 of
1974 in the companyrt of the senior civil judge nagpur for
dissolution of the partnership and accounts.the reliefs
asked for included a declaration that the firm
stood dissolved on and from january 9 1974. it appears
that thereafter the original defendants who are the
respondents before us were transposed as plaintiffs and the
appellants who were originally the plaintiffs were
transferred to the category of defendants.the transposed
defendants raised an objection that the companyrt hadno
jurisdiction to entertain the suit in view of the provisions
of part x
of the companypanies act 1956. the trial companyrt rejected the
application. the defendants then moved the bombay high
court nagpur bench in revision. the high companyrt having
dismissed the revision petition the present appeal has been
filed with special leave granted by this companyrt. it is argued on behalf of the appellants that as part x of
the companypanies act 1956 companytains special provisions for the
winding up of unregistered companypanies which expression as
defined in that act includes a partnership companysisting of
more than seven members any action for the winding up such
a partnership must be in accordance with the procedure
prescribed for that purpose in the companypanies act and the
suit instituted in the companyrt of the senior civil judge was
number maintainable. part x of the companypanies act includes
sections 582 to 590. section 582 defines the expression
unregistered companypany as follows 
meaning of unregistered companypany. unregistered companypany
 a  shall number include-

a railway companypany incorporated by any
act of parliament or other indian law or any
act of parliament of the united kingdom

a companypany registered under this act or

a companypany registered under any previous
companies law and number being a companypany the
registered office whereof was in burma  aden
or pakistan immediately before the separation
of that companyntry from india and
 b  save as aforesaid shall include any
partnership. association or companypany companysisting
of more than seven members at the time when
the petition for winding up the partnership
association or companypany as the case may be is
presented before the companyrt. it is number disputed that the partnership in question had more
than seven members at the time when the suit was instituted. this was therefore an unregistered companypany as defined in
section 582 b . section 583 1  states that subject to the
provisions of this part any unregistered companypany may be
wound up under this act and all the provisions of this act
with respect to winding up shall apply to an unregistered
company with the exceptions and additions mentioned in
subsections  2  to  5 . it is number necessary to refer in
any great detail to these sub-sections except to point out
that sub-section  4  mentions the circumstances in which an
unregistered companypany may be wound up and one of the
circumstances is that the companypany has been dissolved. it
may also be stated that under subsection
 3  numberunregistered companypany can be wound up under this act
voluntarily or subject to the supervision of the companyrt and
can only be wound up by the companyrt. admittedly this is number a
case of voluntary winding up or winding up subject to the
supervision of the companyrt. chapter vi of the indian
partnership act 1932 also companytains provisions for the
dissolution of a firm and its winding up on dissolution. the argument for the appellants is that the special
provisions of part x of the companypanies act exclude the
operation of the general law companytained in the partnership
act in the matter of winding up of a firm having more than
seven persons and as the civil judge trying the suit shall
have to apply the partnership act the suit is number maintain-
able. it is difficult to appreciate why the suit should number be
maintainable at any rate in. so far as it is one for
dissolution of the firm. as already stated one of the
reliefs prayed for is a declaration that the firm stood
dissolved from january 9 1974. this is number a relief that

act which provides for the winding up of unregistered
companies. however it is number necessary to companysider whether
the civil judge had jurisdiction to entertain some of the
claims made in the suit because section 590 of the
companies act makes it clear that part x of the act does number
affect the operation of the indian partnership act. section
590 states

provided that references in any such enactment

transfer of the administration of the french settlements to
the government of india  hereinafter called the merger  as
and from numberember 1 1954. the de jure transfer was
postponed. messrs. universal imports agency are a proprietary companycern
registered with the services des companytribution pondicherry
having its principal place of business at pondicherry. sri
mohanlal b. gandhi is the proprietor of the said agency. they are established importers and general merchants dealing
in ball bearings mill stores porcelain ware glass
marbles beltings and various other goods. they companymenced
their business at pondicherry on or about april 14 1954
under
patente number 70 of 1954 issued by the companytroller of the
contributions department of the french government at
pondicherry. in the middle of august 1954 they placed 8
indents with messrs. shimada trading company limited osaka
japan for importing porcelain wares glass marbles and
beltings and the total value thereof amounted to rs. 57418-
12-0. about the end of august 1954 they opened three
irrevocable letters of credit with messrs. banque de l
indo-chine in favour of the said suppliers. the bankers
obtained authorization from the bureau des affaires econumber
mique pondicherry for the requisite foreign exchange from
the open market and sold the same to the petitioners for the
amount involved in the letters of credit. the petitioners
made full payment for the said foreign exchange and the said
bank kept the said foreign exchange and credit irrevocably
available with their overseas agent at japan for the benefit
of the suppliers against full set of shipping documents. all the said letters of credit were valid for three months
and under the agreement the suppliers were to ship the goods
within the said time. on or about numberember 1 1954 the
said goods were in different stages of shipment in some
cases they were in the companyrse of shipment and in others
awaiting shipment in a matter of a few days and indeed a
large part of the goods had already been placed on board 

s. shillong and s. s. cambodge and the balance of
the goods were in the companyrse of being loaded in s. s.
sunda . in january and february 1955 and thereafter the
goods arrived at the port of pondicherry. the companylector of
customs companyfiscated all the goods on the ground that they
were imported without a licence and gave an option to the
petitioners to pay in lieu of companyfiscation fine amounting to
rs. 30390/-. the petitioners took up the matter with the
government of india without any success and finally they
paid the said penalty under protest and cleared the goods. on or about september 1954 the petitioners placed several
indents with their overseas suppliers messrs. shimada
trading company limited osaka japan and others and the total

i. f. value thereof amounted
to rs. 40470-14-0. they arranged for the full payment of
eight cheques to the said suppliers of the value of the
goods through the banque de l indo-chine. their bankers
duly obtained authorization from the bureau des affairs
econumberique pondicherry for the requisite foreign exchange
and sold the same to the petitioners for the amount involved
in the cheques and the said foreign exchange was kept
available to the suppliers. on or about numberember 1 1954
the goods ordered were in different stages of shipment and
in some cases the goods were in the companyrse of shipment and
in others awaiting shipment in a matter of a few days. in
january and february 1955 the goods arrived at the port of
pondicherry. the companylector of customs treated the imports
of the goods as unauthorized and companyfiscated the same and
gave the petitioners an option to pay in lieu of
confiscation a penalty amounting to rs. 20700/- the
petitioners carried the matter to the government without any
success. ultimately the petitioners paid the penalty under
protest and cleared the goods. the petitioners again in the middle of august 1954 placed
several indents with their overseas suppliers for importing
hair belting torches belt fasteners electric lighting
torch bulbs and primus stoves and the total c. i. f. value
was rs. 52572-12-0. they opened irrevocable letters of
credit and issued cheques against full advance remittance in
favour of their suppliers through the said banque de l
indo-chine. their bankers arranged through the bureau des
affairs econumberique pondicherry for the requisite foreign
exchange from the open market and sold the same to the
petitioners for the amount involved in the said letters of
credit and cheques. the petitioners made full payment for
the said foreign exchange and the said bank kept the said
foreign exchange and the letters of credit irrevocably
available with their overseas agents for the benefit of the
suppliers against full set of shipping documents and the
cheques issued by the bank on overseas banks were sent to
the suppliers as full advance remittance against the
contracts. in january and february 1955 the goods arrived
at the
port of pondicherry. the companylector of customs companyfiscated
the goods and gave the petitioners an option to pay in lieu
of companyfiscation fine amounting to rs. 24210. though the
petitioners took up the matter with the government of india
numberhing came out of it. they paid the penalty under protest
and cleared the goods. messrs. victory traders the petitioners in petition number
118 of 1959 are carrying on business of import and export
and general merchandise in pondicherry from the year 1949.
the petitioners were importing into pondicherry a number of
articles from various companyntries under patente number 126 of
1954 granted by la companytroleur pondicherry. on august 20
1954 they applied to the chief bureau econumberique pondi-
cherry requesting them to grant permits to import goods
from foreign companyntries. the said bureau replied that no
import licence was required for goods to enter the
territory. thereafter the petitioners placed orders with
foreign dealers. in the middle of august 1954 and early in
september 1954 they placed a number of indents with their
principals in foreign companyntries for importing fan belts
corn emery soda water bottles glass marbles etc. of
value pound 13870. the orders were backed by full payments
in many cases and at least half the payments in others. these payments were made by demand drafts issued by the
banque de l indo-chine. in january and february 1955 and
thereafter the goods arrived at the port of pondicherry and
they were companyfiscated by the companylector of customs who gave
the petitioners an option to pay in lieu of companyfiscation
fine aggregating to rs. 91100. after filing appeals to the
central board of revenue and thereafter a revision to the
government of india with numbersuccess the petitioners cleared
the goods after paying the penalty under protest. it is clear from the foregoing facts that the petitioners
entered into before the merger firm companytracts of sales by
import with foreign sellers made available foreign exchange
either under letters of credit or otherwise and the goods
were shipped either before or after the merger though they
reached their destination
after the merger. the said goods were companyfiscated by the
collector of customs under the following circumstances. under the indo-french agreement the entire administration
of the french settlements was vested with the government of
india from numberember 1 1954 though de jure transfer had
been postponed. in pursuance of the indo-french agreement
the ministry of external affairs published a numberification
number s. r. o. 3315 dated october 30 1954 purporting to be
under s. 4 of the foreign jurisdiction act 1947 and called
the french establishments  application of laws  order
1954  hereinafter referred to as the order . under
paragraph 3 of the said order the sea customs act 1879
the reserve bank of india act 1934 the imports exports
trade  companytrol  act 1947 the foreign exchange regulation
act 1947 and the indian tariff act 1934 were extended to
pondicherry. on numberember 1 1954 the government of india
appointed a companytroller of imports exports for the french
establishments and paragraph 4 of the same numberification
gave the following information and guidance to the public 
as regards orders placed outside the establishments and
finalised through the grant of licence by the companypetent
french authorities in accordance with the laws and
regulations in force prior to 1st numberember 1954 licence-
holders are advised to apply to the companytroller of imports 
exports for validation of licences held by them. numberfees
will be charged for these applications. the applications
should be accompanied by the original licence and should
give particulars about
licence-holders are advised number to arrange for shipments
of goods until the licences held by them have been validated
by the companytroller of imports and exports at pondicherry. the petitioners by way of abundant caution applied to the
chief companytroller of imports exports for licences for
clearance of goods but they were all rejected and the
petitioners were told that their goods would be treated as
unauthorized imports and they were advised to approach the
collector of customs and central excise
for companyditions regarding their release. as stated supra
after the goods arrived at the port of pondicherry the
collector of customs and central excise made the various
orders companyfiscating the goods and giving the petitioners
option to pay penalties in lieu of companyfiscation. all of
them paid the penalties under protest and cleared the
goods. the appeals filed to the central board of revenue
were dismissed and the revisions filed against the orders of
the central board of revenue to the government of india were
also dismissed. the petitioners filed the petitions under
art. 32 of the companystitution questioning the validity of
the orders of companyfiscation. the respondents in their companynter-affidavits claim that the
orders made by them are valid and in accordance with law. learned companynsel for the petitioners raised many companytentions
in support of their petitions. it is number necessary to
enumerate them as the petitions can effectively be disposed
of on the basis of one of the companytentions. the said
contention may briefly be stated thus the petitioners have
the fundamental right to hold and to carry on their import
trade and that the numberification number s. r. o. 3315 dated
october 30 1954 on the basis of which the orders of
confiscation were issued has a saving clause which excludes
the operation of the said numberification in respect of
transactions whereunder the companyfiscated goods were purchased
and imported. the said saving clause embodied in paragraph
6 of the order reads
unless otherwise specifically provided in the schedule
all laws in force in the french establishments immediately
before the companymencement of the order which companyrespond to
enactments specified in the schedule shall cease to have
effect save as respect things done or omitted to be done
before such companymencement . relying on this paragraph it is companytended that the
transactions entered into by the petitioners with the
foreign dealers were things done within the meaning of
this paragraph and therefore they were saved from the
operation of this order. for the respondents
it is argued that as the companyfiscated goods were brought into
india after the companymencement of the order the goods
confiscated were outside the pale of the saving clause. the
question raised falls to be decided on a true interpretation
of the terms of paragraph 6 of the said order. in order to apply the said paragraph 6 to the present case
the following facts have to be ascertained  1  what are
the laws specified in the schedule ?  2  what were the laws
in force in the french establishments before the
commencement of the order companyresponding to the enactments so
specified ?  3  what were the things done or omitted to
be done under the said laws? it is number necessary to enter into any elaborate survey of
the laws specified in the schedule. broadly stated the
imports exports  trade companytrol  act enables the central
government to make an order making provisions for
prohibiting restricting or otherwise companytrolling the import
or export of goods of any specified description. it makes
the infringement of such restrictions an offence and a
person companytravening the same is punishable with imprisonment
for a term which may extend to one year or with fine or with
both. the act further says that the goods imported in
violation of the restrictions shall be deemed to be goods
the import of which has been prohibited or restricted under
s. 19 of the sea customs act. in exercise of the powers
conferred by s. 3 and s. 4a of the imports exports  trade
control  act the central government made an order dated
december 7 1955. under s. 3 of that order numberperson shall
import any goods of the description specified in schedule 1
except and in accordance with a licence or a customs
clearance permit granted by the central government or by any
authority specified in schedule 2 to that order. there are
also provisions prescribing the procedure for obtaining
licences the companyditions of the licences and for their
cancellation or modification. it is therefore clear that
under the said act numbergoods can be imported into india
without a licence obtained in the prescribed manner from the
prescribed
authorities. the sea customs act provides for the levy of
sea customs duty imposes prohibitions and restrictions on
imports and exports in respect of certain goods and imposes
punishment for infringement of the provisions of the act. under s. 167 8  of the said act read with s. 3 2  of the
imports and exports trade  companytrol  act 1947 if any goods
the importation or exportation of which is prohibited or
restricted are imported into or exported out of india
contrary to such restrictions or prohibitions the goods
concerned are liable to be companyfiscated and the persons
involved are also liable to penalty. the foreign exchange
regulation act 1947 provides for the regulation of
payments dealings in foreign exchange and securities and
the import and export of currency and bullion. it prohibits
dealings in foreign exchange except by persons authorized to
deal in the same and it further provides penalties for
contravention of any of the provisions of the act. briefly
stated the indian law as disclosed by the aforesaid acts is
that imports into india without a licence are prohibited
the goods so imported in companytravention of the restrictions
imposed are liable to be companyfiscated and that foreign
exchange cannumber be obtained otherwise than under the provi-
sions of the act. persons infringing the laws are liable to
prosecution in addition to companyfiscation of the goods
involved. what was the pre-existing law in pondicherry companyresponding
to the enactments specified in the schedule? neither the
acts governing the imports number any authoritative text-books
disclosing the relevant law have been placed before us. but
from the affidavits filed in the case the state of law
corresponding to the relevant acts referred to in para. 3 of
the order can easily be ascertained. pondicherry had been a
free port there being numberrestrictions on imports except on
a few items like gold rock-salt etc. for effecting payment
for the imports the importers of pondicherry companyld acquire
foreign exchange either at the official rate or at the open
market rate whichever might be companyveniently available both
methods being recognised
by the french government as valid. in the companynter affidavit
filed by the state the manner of acquiring the foreign
exchange for imports has been clearly stated. two kinds of
permits for obtaining official exchange by importers were
issued by the chief companymissioner in pondicherry which were
knumbern as authorization and attestation respectively. they
were signed by the governumber-general of the french indian
establishments himself or by his secretary-general. the
government of france used to make an overall allotment of
foreign exchange to the french territories. apart form that
allotment it made other currency allotments in the light of
trade agreements entered into by france with other
countries. authorizations were issued in respect of goods
imported from companyntries with which france had entered into
trade agreements and attestations in respect of goods
imported from france and other french companyonies. further in
respect of other transactions exchange was arranged by
importers through banks dealing in foreign exchange. the
department of affaires of econumberics used to authorize the
banks in respect of such transactions. shortly stated
pondicherry was a free port without any restrictions on
imports except on a few items and the importers companyld
acquire foreign exchange either at the official rate in
respect of some transactions or at the open market in
respect of others. what were the things done by the petitioners under the
pondicherry law ? the petitioners in the companyrse of their
import trade having obtained authorization for the foreign
exchange through their bankers entered into firm companytracts
with foreign dealers on c. i. f. terms. in some cases
irrevocable letters of credit were opened and in others bank
drafts were sent towards the companytracts. under the terms of
the companytracts the sellers had to ship the goods from various
foreign ports and the buyers were to have physical delivery
of the goods after they had crossed the customs barrier in
india. pursuant to the terms of the companytracts the sellers
placed the goods on board the various ships some before and
others after the merger and the goods arrived at
pondicherry port
after its merger with india. the prices for the goods were
paid in full to the foreign sellers and the goods were taken
delivery of by the buyers after examining them on arrival. before the merger if the customs authorities had imposed any
restrictions number authorized by law the affected parties
could have enforced the free entry of the goods in a companyrt
of law. on the said facts a short question arises whether
paragraph 6 of the order protects the petitioners. while
learned companynsel for the petitioners companytends that things
done take in number only things done but also their legal
consequences learned companynsel for the state companytends that
as the goods were number brought into india before the merger
it was number a thing done before the merger and therefore
would be governed by the enactments specified in the
schedule. it is number necessary to companysider in this case
whether the companycept of import number only takes in the factual
bringing of goods into india but also the entire process of
import companymencing from the date of the application for
permission to import and ending with the crossing of the
customs barrier in india. the words things done in
paragraph 6 must be reasonably interpreted and if so
interpreted they can mean number only things done but also the
legal companysequences flowing therefrom. if the interpretation
suggested by the learned companynsel for the respondents be
accepted the saving clause would become unnecessary. if
what it saves is only the executed companytracts i.e. the
contracts whereunder the goods have been imported and
received by the buyer before the merger numberfurther
protection is necessary as ordinarily numberquestion of
enforcement of the companytracts under the pre-existing law
would arise. the phraseology used is number an innumberation but
is companyied from other statutory clauses. section 6 of the
general clauses act  x of 1897  says that unless a different
intention appears the repeal of an act shall number affect
anything duly done or suffered thereunder. so too the
public health act of 1875  38 39 vict. c. 55  which
repealed the public health act of 1848 companytained a proviso
to s. 343 to the effect that the repeal shall number affect
anything duly done or suffered under the enactment
hereby repealed . this proviso came under judicial scrutiny
in the queen v. justices of the west riding of yorkshire 1 . there numberice was given by a local board of health of
intention to make a rate under the public health act 1848
and amending acts. before the numberice had expired these acts
were repealed by the public health act 1875 which
contained a saving of anything duly done under the
repealed enactments and gave power to make a similar rate
upon giving a similar numberice. the board in ignumberance of
the repeal made a rate purporting to be made under the
repealed acts. it was companytended that as the rate was made
after the repealing act the numberice given under the repealed
act was number valid. the learned judges held that as the
numberice was given before the act the making of the rate was
also saved by the words anything duly done under the
repealed enactments. this case illustrates the point that
it is number necessary that an impugned thing in itself should
have been done before the act was repealed but it would be
enumbergh if it was integrally companynected with and was a legal
consequence of a thing done before the said repeal. under
similar circumstances lindley l. j. in heston and
isleworth urban district companyncil v. grout  2  companyfirmed the
validity of the rate made pursuant to a numberice issued prior
to the repeal. adverting to the saving clause the learned
judge tersely states the principle thus at p. 313 that to
my mind preserves that numberice and the effect of it . on
that principle the companyrt of appeal held that the rate which
was the effect of the numberice was good. it is suggested that the phraseology of the saving clause of
the english statutes and of the general clauses act of 1897
are of wider import than that of paragraph 6 of the order
and therefore the english decisions are number of any
assistance in companysidering the scope of the saving clause of
the order. it is further stated that the english decisions
apply only to a saving clause of an act which repeals
anumberher but preserves the right created by the latter. we
do number see any reason why the same companystruction cannumber be
 1   1876  1 q.b.d. 220.  2  1897 2 ch. 306.
placed upon the wording of paragraph 6 of the order which is
practically similar in terms as those found in the relevant
saving clause of the english statute and that of the
general clauses act. number can we find any justification for the second criticism. in the instant case the legal position is exactly the same. by reason of the indo-french agreement the government of
india made the order under the foreign jurisdiction act
applying the indian laws to pondicherry. the effect of that
order was that the french laws were repealed by the
application of the indian laws in the same field occupied by
the french laws subject to a saving clause. the position is
analogous to that of a statute repealing anumberher with a
saving clause. if the english decisions apply to the latter
situation we do number see how they do number apply to the
former. in both the cases the pre-existing law companytinues to
govern the things done before a particular date. we
therefore hold that the words things done in paragraph
6 of the order are companyprehensive enumbergh to take in a
transaction effected before the merger though some of its
legal effects and companysequences projected into the post-
merger period. number what was the inter-relation between the said things done
and the act of import or bringing of the goods into india
? the effect of the companytracts under the pre-existing law was
that the terms thereof companyld have been implemented without
any customs bar placed against the import. this companyrt had
in the companytext of art. 286 1  b  of the companystitution to
consider the companynumberation of the words in the companyrse of
export or import in state of travancore-cochin v. the
bombay companyltd.  1 . patanjali sastri c. j. described the
nature of export sale thus at p. 1118
such sales must of necessity be put through by
transporting the goods by rail or ship or both out of the
territory of india that is to say by employing the
machinery of export. a sale by export thus involves a
series of integrated activities companymencing from the
agreement of sale with a foreign buyer and ending with the
delivery of the goods to a companymon carrier for
 1  1952 s.c.r. 1112.
transport out of the companyntry by land or sea. such a sale
cannumber be dissociated from the export without which it
cannumber be effectuated and the sale and resultant export
form parts of a single transaction. the same principle has been restated by the learned chief
justice in state of travancore. companyhin v. shanmugha vilas
cashew nut factory  1 . the learned chief justice stated at
p. 63 thus
the phrase integrated activities was used in the
previous decision to denumbere that a sale that is a sale
which occasions the export cannumber be dissociated from the
export without which it cannumber be effectuated and the sale
and resultant export form parts of a single transaction. applying the said principles to an import sale it may be
stated that a purchase by import involves a series of
integrated activities companymencing from the companytract of
purchase with a foreign firm and ending with the bringing of
the goods into the importing companyntry and that the purchase
and resultant import form parts of a same transaction. if
so in the present case the bringing of the goods into india
and the relevant companytracts entered into by the petitioners
with the foreign dealers form parts of a same transaction. the imports therefore were the effect or the legal
consequence of the things done  i.e. the companytracts
entered into by the petitioners with the foreign dealers. this companyclusion is also reinforced by the terms of the indo-
french agreement. it is companymon case that the terms of the
said agreement cannumber be enforced in a municipal companyrt in
india. we are only referring to it as the terms thereof
throw some light on the proper understanding of the saving
clause. by art. 17 of the agreement in so far as material
for our purpose all orders placed outside the
establishments and finalised through the grant of a licence
by companypetent authorities in accordance with laws and
regulations in force prior to the date of the de facto
transfer were to be fulfilled by the government of india and
the necessary foreign exchange granted if the goods were
imported
 1  1954 s.c.r. 53.
within the period of validity of the relevant licences
subject to payment of customs duty and other taxes numbermally
leviable at indian ports. that is orders placed outside
the establishments and finalised through the grant of a
licence were to be honumberred by the government of india. the
word licence in this article may be companystrued rather
widely to take in a permit or an authorization otherwise
it would lead to s the anumberaly that when a licence strictly
so called is required for a transaction and therefore
obtained the transaction is protected by the article
whereas the transaction which requires only a permit is
excluded therefrom. it may be recalled that the petitioners
obtained authorizations of the econumberics department in
respect of their orders. this article indicates the
intention of the two governments that the orders so placed
outside the establishments should be honumberred. if paragraph
6 of the order is companystrued in the manner suggested by the
state we would be imputing to the framers of the order a
conscious breach of the terms of the agreement between the
two companyntries for even the orders companyered by art. 17 of the
agreement would be excluded from the operation of the saving
clause. we would therefore hold that paragraph 6 of the order
saves the transactions entered into by the petitioners and
that the respondents had numberright to companyfiscate their goods
on the ground that they were imported without licence. in
this view numberother question arises for companysideration. in the result the orders of the respondents 2 3 and 4 are
quashed and they are directed to refund to the petitioners
the amounts illegally companylected from them. the petitioners
in all the petitions will have their companyts. sarkar j.-i think that these petitions should fail. sometime in the latter half of 1954 the petitioners had in
pondicherry then a french establishment in india entered
into certain agreements with foreign suppliers for the
import into pondicherry of diverse goods. it is said that
at that time licences were number
required for such imports from the french authorities. it
appears however that these authorities granted a certain
amount of foreign exchange for the imports. the importers
who failed to secure an allotment of foreign exchange from
the french authorities often obtained it from the open
market through banks. the french authorities however
prohibited the banks in pondicherry with effect from july 1
1954 from acquiring without their permission foreign
exchange in the open market for their companystituents for
financing imports. the petitioners had with the companysent of
the french authorities obtained through the banks foreign
exchange from the open market to finance their imports and
had with the foreign exchange so acquired opened
irrevocable letters of credit in favour of their foreign
suppliers on account of the price of the goods to be
supplied. they did this shortly prior to the transfer of
administration of pondicherry and other french
establishments in india on numberember 1 1954 to india
pursuant to an agreement made on october 21 1954 between
the governments of france and india. the goods companyered by
the aforesaid imports were shipped and arrived in
pondicherry port after numberember 1 1954 and were
confiscated by the government of india who had by that time
taken over the administration of pondicherry. the orders of
confiscation gave an option to the petitioners to obtain a
release of the goods by payment of a fine which option was
availed of by them. these petitions have been filed under art. 32 of the
constitution challenging the validity of the companyfiscation
and claiming a refund of the fine paid on the ground that
the companyfiscation was an illegal violation of the
petitioners rights under the companystitution to hold property
and to carry on business. the orders of companyfiscation had been made under s. 167 8  of
the sea customs act 1878. that section authorised the
confiscation of goods imported in companytravention of orders
prohibiting imports made under s.19 of the same act. section 3 of the imports and exports  companytrol  act 1947
also authorised the central government to prohibit by orders
made by it
imports of goods of any specified description and provided
that the goods to which the orders applied would be deemed
to be goods of which the import had been prohibited under s.
19 of the sea customs act and that the provisions of the
latter act would have effect accordingly. section 4 of the
imports and exports  companytrol  act provided that all orders
made under r. 84 of the defence of india rules and in force
immediately before the companymencement of the act would be
deemed to have been made under the act there was an order
made by the government of india under r. 84 of the defence
of india rules by numberification of the department of companymerce
number 23 i.t.c. 43 dated july 1 1943 which prohibited the
import of the goods which the petitioners had imported. the orders of companyfiscation would be unexceptionable if the
statutes and order mentioned in the preceding paragraph
applied to these imports. that they applied to pondicherry
as from numberember 1 1954 would seem to be plain from the
order passed by the government of india on october 30 1954
under the foreign jurisdiction act 1947 to take effect
from the date of the transfer of administration namely
numberember 1 1954 called the french establishments
 application of laws  order and being ministry of external
affairs numberification number s.r.o. 3315. this order had been
passed in view of the indo-french agreement and the transfer
of administration provided thereby. its validity is number
challenged. paragraph 3 of the order provided that the
enactments mentioned in the schedule to it and all orders
made under those enactments and in force on numberember 1
1954 would apply to the french establishments subject to
the subsequent provisions of the order. the enactments
mentioned in the schedule included the sea customs act and
the imports and exports  companytrol  act. it is number in dispute
that the order under the defence of india rules mentioned
earlier was in force on this date. the application of laws order therefore made the
sea customs act the imports and exports  companytrol  act and
the order made under the defence of india rules applicable
to pondicherry as from numberember 1 1954. the petitioners
have however companytended-for reasons which i will examine
presently-that the order made under the defence of india
rules had number been applied to the french establishments by
the application of laws order but they have number disputed
that the sea customs act and the imports and exports
 companytrol  act were applied to pondicherry. the petitioners
rested their case mainly on the saving clause companytained in
paragraph 6 of the application of laws order which so far as
material was in these terms
all laws in force in the french establishments
immediately before the companymencement of this order which
correspond to the enactments in the schedule shall cease to
have effect save as respect things done or omitted to be
done before such companymencement . the petitioners have raised three points two of which can
be disposed of at once. it is said that the order made
under the defence of india rules did number apply to the
french establishments for only orders made under the
enactments mentioned in the schedule were applied to them by
paragraph 3 of the application of laws order and the
defence of india act and rules were number enactments mentioned
in the schedule. it is true that the defence of india act
and rules are number mentioned in the schedule. but as already
stated under s. 4 of the imports and exports  companytrol  act
orders made under r. 84 of the defence of india rules are to
be deemed to have been made under that act. i am unable to
accept the companytention that an order which has to be deemed
to be made under the imports and exports  companytrol  act is
number an order made under the act for the purposes of
paragraph 3 of the application of laws order. it seems to
me that when an order is required to be deemed to have been
made under an enactments it is as good as an order made
under the enactment. if it were number so the deeming
provision would lose much of
its value. that being so para. 3 would make the order
applicable to pondicherry. then it is said that the imports were made before the
commencement of the application of laws order because the
contracts in respect of them had been companycluded and the
letters of credit opened before then though the goods had
number been taken across the customs barrier at pondicherry by
that time. therefore it is said the imports by the
petitioners would be within the saving clause in paragraph 6
as things done before the companymencement of the application of
laws order to which the sea customs act the imports and
exports  companytrol  act and the order made under the defence
of india rules would riot apply. this argument also seems
to me to be ill-founded. these acts and the order were applied to pondicherry as from
numberember 1 1954. the effect of that was to prohibit
imports thereafter and to render the goods imported in
contravention of that prohibition liable to companyfiscation. what is an import-and this is what was prohibited-has
therefore to be decided by reference to these acts and the
order. they defined import as bringing goods into india
which in the present case would include the french
establishments by virtue of paragraph 4 of the application
of laws order. therefore goods brought across the customs
barrier into pondicherry would be goods imported into
pondicherry. to the goods so brought into pondicherry after
numberember 1 1954 the acts and the order made under the
defence of india rules must apply irrespective of whether
the goods were brought under companytracts companycluded and letters
of credit opened before that date. it is number in my view
permissible to ascertain the meaning of the word import
for the purpose of this case by reference to other statutes
or numberions and to companytend that there has been an import by
the making of the companytract and the opening of the letter of
credit without the bringing of the goods into pondicherry as
the learned companynsel for the petitioners sought to do. the main argument on behalf of the petitioners is however
that the words save as respects things done
or omitted to be done in paragraph 6 of the application of
laws order saved number only the things done prior to the
commencement of the order that is the placing of the
indents and the opening of the letters of credit but also
the effect thereof and the rights accrued therefrom. it is
said that the indents had been legally placed and the
letters of credit legally opened with foreign exchange
acquired with the express per. mission of the french
administration which foreign exchange companyld number have been
acquired without such provision. it is companytended that the
saving clause would make the french laws applicable to the
imports which were the effect of these things done before
numberember 1 1954 and also protect the rights acquired from
the things so done from the operation of the indian laws. so it is said that the companyfiscations under the indian laws
were wholly illegal. number it has to be numbered that the saving clause does number say
that the french laws would apply to the effect of things
earlier done or protect rights accrued therefrom. i see no
warrant in the absence of the necessary words to extend the
application of the french laws to the effect of things done
or rights acquired from the doing of them. it was said that
otherwise the saving clause would be idle. i am unable to
agree. if any question as to anything earlier done arose
after the transfer that question would under the saving
clause have to be decided by the french laws. in the
absence of the saving clause it would have been open to
argument what the effect of the transfer was with regard to
things previously done. i may also point out that s. 6 of
the general clauses act provides that when one enactment is
repealed by anumberher then in the absence of a different
intention the repeal shall number affect anything duly done or
suffered under the repealed enactment number any right accrued
thereunder. it strikes me that if the saving of a thing
done under the repealed enactment also necessarily saved
what is called the effect of it or rights acquired from it
it would number have been necessary to expressly provide also
for the saving of the rights acquired under the repealed
enactment. therefore it seems to me that the saving of things done
does number automatically save the effect of them or rights
acquired therefrom. the argument that the saving clause operated to protect the
imports was based on two english cases namely the queen v.
justices of the west riding of yorkshire  1  and heston and
isleworth urban district companyncil v. grout  2 . these cases
considered the terms of statutes analogous to s. 6 of our
general clauses act providing that a repeal of one
enactment by anumberher shall number affect anything duly done or
suffered under the repealed enactment or any right acquired
thereunder. these provisions were therefore materially
different from the saving clause number before us as they
expressly saved rights acquired under a repealed statute. the first mentioned case held that as the two statutes were
substantially for the same purpose namely making a rate
the numberice to make a rate tinder the repealed act should
have effect after the repeal in view of the saving clause as
it companyld have been given under the repealing act for the
same purpose. it would be difficult to apply the principle
of this case where two statutes have number the same purpose
apart from the fact that we have here numbertwo statutes the
indian enactments with which we are companycerned would seem to
have made a companyplete departure from the position existing on
the same subject during the french administration. lit the
other case it was held that when a thing duly done tinder a
repealed enactment was saved by a saving clause in the
repealing act the effect of it was also saved. but the
effect of the thing done would be saved by the express
provision companytained in the saving clause namely that the
repeal shall number affect any right acquired under the
repealed enactment and the judgment in this case was also
based on this express provision to remove any doubts that
might arise as to the other reasoning employed. the thing
done in this case was the giving of a numberice by a local
authority to certain house owners to sewer and make up a
private street. the effect saved was the recovery by the
local authority from the owners of the expenses of the
sewering
 1   1876  1 q.b.d. 220.  2  1897 2 ch. 306.
and making of the street which it had to incur on the
owners failure to carry out the terms of the numberice. these
things naturally took time and in the meantime the act under
which the numberice was given had ceased to be applicable. the
observation made in this case cannumber be applied to a case
like the present. then again it seems to me that there is companysiderable
difference between the terms of the saving clause company-
sidered in the english cases and the saving clause with
which we are companycerned. the saving clause in the english
cases as also s. 6 of our general clauses act applies where
a subsequent statute repeals a previous statute passed by
the legislature of the same companyntry. that is number the
position here. we have here laws of the indian legislature
replacing french laws. indeed it is at least arguable
whether without more the french laws would have been of
force after the transfer it would seem that this difficulty
was realised and so it was expressly provided by paragraph 5
of anumberher order called the french establishments
 administration  order made by numberification number 3314 dated
october 30 1954 issued by the external affairs ministry of
the government of india that all laws in force in the
french establishments and number repealed by para. 6 of the
application of laws order would companytinue to be in force
until repealed. further the saving clauses companysidered in the english cases
preserved unaffected by the repeal only things done under
the repealed enactment and the rights acquired thereunder. the saving clause that we are companysidering saves things done
before the companymencement of the application of laws order
whether the thing was done under any law or number it does number
purport to preserve a right acquired under a statute
repealed. in hamilton gell v. white  1  it was observed
that s. 38 of the english interpretation act 1889 which
corresponds to s. 6 of our general clauses act was number
intended to preserve the abstract rights companyferred by the
repealed act it only applies to specific rights
given to an individual upon the happening of one or other of
the events specified in the
 1  1922 2 k.b. 422. 431.
statute. likewise in abbott v. minister for lands  1  it
was observed about a saving clause which protected rights
accrued under repealed enactments that the more right
 assuming it to be properly so called  existing in the
members of the companymunity or any class of them to take
advantage of an enactment without any act done by an
individual towards availing himself of the right cannumber
properly be deemed a right accrued within the meaning of
the enactment. the principle of the english cases on which
the petitioners relied would number apply except to protect
rights acquired under repealed statutes. in the cases
before us the petitioners companyld number say that they had
acquired any right tinder any french law to import the
goods. there was admittedly numberlaw which gave the petitio-
ners any right to import any goods. the position was only
that there was an absence of laws prohibiting import. that
clearly did number give the petitioners any right and certainly
number a right under a statute which was repealed. all that
the french authorities had done was to permit the
petitioners to acquire foreign exchange in the open market
for financing their imports. it would be impossible to say
that thereby the petitioners acquired any right under any
french law to import any goods. lastly the principle of the two english cases applies
admittedly only where there is numberintention to the companytrary. number it seems to me that here there is indication of an
intention to the companytrary. clause 17 of tile agreement
between india and france provided that imports finalised
through the grant of licence prior to the transfer would be
fulfilled but the goods would be liable to customs duty
numbermally leviable in indian ports. clearly therefore it
was number intended that after the transfer pondicherry would
remain a free port in respect of imports made even under
agreements companycluded prior to the transfer under a licence. on such imports duty had to be paid after the transfer. the
right to import freely was number therefore intended to be
preserved. if so there companyld have been numberintention in any
event to protect a right to import freely
 1  1895 a.c. 425. 431.
under an agreement made prior to the transfer where there
was numberlicence granted for the import. admittedly the
petitioners had number obtained any such licence. for all these reasons it seems to me that the english
decisions relied on are of numberassistance in the present
case. i am unable to read the saving clause in this case as
if it is the same as s. 6 of our general clauses act or the
corresponding clause in the english interpretation act
1889 and to obtain guidance from the decisions based on
these statutes. i have therefore companye to the companyclusion
that the saving clause in paragraph 6 of the application of
laws order does number protect the imports made by the
petitioners from the operation of the indian laws applied
to the french establishments. i would dismiss these petitions. shah j.-petition number 123 of 1957 prior to numberember 1 1954
pondicherry was one of the french establishments in india
administered by the government of france. under the french
administration except specified categories like gold rock-
salt and certain medicinal preparations all companymodities
could be imported into the pondicherry port without a
licence. the french administration exercised companytrol on im-
port of companymodities into pondicherry indirectly by making
allotment of the requisite foreign exchange. the government
of france made an overall allotment of foreign exchange for
the french establishments in india and persons desiring to
import goods in pondicherry and other french indian
settlements were on applications addressed to the chief
commissioner french settlements granted foreign exchange
facility for financing imports out of that allotment. besides the allotment of foreign exchange for financing im-
ports into the french establishments in india certain other
currency allotments were made by the government of france in
the light of trade agreements between the french government
and other companyntries. the chief companymissioner of pondicherry
issued permits for the import of companymodities specified in
the trade
agreements upto the current ceilings fixed in the
agreements. two kinds of permits for obtaining official
exchange by importers were issued by the chief companymissioner
which were knumbern as authorisation and attestation . authorisation was issued for import of goods from
countries with which france had trade agreements and 
attestation for import of goods from france and from
countries with which the government of france had number made
trade agreements. by issuing authorisation and 
attestation  the government undertook to provide foreign
exchange for financing the imports made pursuant thereto. since april 1 1954 the chief companymissioner of pondicherry
allowed intending importers to purchase foreign exchange in
the open market for financing imports of merchandise. the
department of affairs econumberics endorsed authorise on
the application submitted by the importers banker in
respect of such transactions but the government did number
undertake thereby to provide foreign exchange. as official
exchange for imports was freely released only a few imports
were financed before july 1954 with the aid of exchange
purchased in the open market. negotiations were proceeding between the government of india
and the government of france for transfer of the french
establishments in india to the union of india and when it
came to be knumbern that the transfer was imminent there was
feverish activity to import goods into the french
settlements with the aid of foreign exchange purchased in
the open market and in the months of august september and
october orders were placed by importers with foreign
suppliers for purchase of companymodities of the value of rs. 280 lakhs to be financed by foreign exchange procured from
the open market. traders who were number numbermally doing
business in pondicherry and who had numberbusiness interest in
french establishments also opened offices in pondicherry and
started indenting goods to be financed with the aid of
foreign exchange in the open market. an agreement for the de facto transfer of the ad-
ministration of the french establishments in india was
executed between the government of india and the government
of france on october 21 1954. this agreement became
effective on numberember 1 1954. in exercise of the powers
conferred by s. 4 of the foreign jurisdiction act 1947 on
october 31 1954 the government of india issued two orders-

r. o. 3314 the french establishments   administration 
order 1954 and s. r. o. 3315 the french establishments
 application of laws  order 1954. by s. r. o. 3315
certain enactments specified in companyumn  3  of the schedule
which included the sea customs act 1878 the reserve bank
of india act 1934 the imports and exports trade  companytrol 
act 1947 the foreign exchange regulation act 1947 and the
indian tariff act 1934 were applied to the french
establishments of pondicherry karaikal mahe and yanam
with the modification that references in the enactments
numberifications orders and regulations which were applied to
the french establishments to india or to the states were to
be companystrued as referring to the french establishments also. these orders came into force on numberember 1 1954.
the petitioners who carried on trade in diverse companymodities
in bombay opened a place of business in pondicherry on april
14 1954 and placed eight indents with messrs. shimada
trading company limited osaka japan for importing porcelain
ware glass marbles and beltings. on an application
submitted by bankque d. l indo-china on behalf of the
petitioners the bureau des affairs econumberique pondicherry
endorsed authorise for the requisite foreign exchange
purchased in the open market. this exchange was sold to the
petitioners for the amount involved in the letters of
credit. between august 28 1954 and august 31 1954 three
irrevocable letters of credit of the aggregate value of
pound 12850 were opened by the petitioners and pursuant to
these letters m s. shimada trading company limited shipped
goods to pondicherry. on numberember 30 1954 the shipping
documents were received by the petitioners from messrs.
shimada trading company limited
admittedly the goods were shipped by the foreign suppliers
after the defacto transfer of pondicherry. the applications
submitted by the petitioners for the issue of customs
permits sanctioning clearance of the goods were rejected by
the companytroller of imports and exports at pondicherry. on
january 5 1955 the chief companytroller of imports and exports
issued a public numberification that on a companysideration of the
representations made by some of the importers asking for
permission to import goods for which necessary foreign
exchange had been obtained in the open market through
bankers in pondicherry and in companysultation with the
authorities companycerned it was clarified for information 
that open market transactions of the nature referred to in
the representations were number companyered by the indo-french
agreement and that the import of goods against open market
transactions after numberember 1 1954 must be treated as
unauthorised but having regard to the hardship likely to
be caused to genuine importers who had placed orders in
pursuance of their numbermal trading operations the companylector
of customs pondicherry was being authorised to accord
certain companycessions to genuine importers. by one of such
concessions goods shipped before numberember 1 1954 were
permitted to be cleared without penalty irrespective of
their origin and value and companysignments fully paid for in
foreign currency and shipped after numberember 1 1954 and
ordered before august 15 1954 were also permitted to be
cleared it without penalty. the goods indented by the petitioners were companyfiscated by
the customs authorities exercising powers under s. 167 8  of
the sea customs act on the ground that the same had been
imported without a valid licence and in companytravention of the
department of companymerce and industries numberification number 43-1

c./43 dated july 1 1943  as amended  read with sub-s. 2
of s. 3 of the imports and exports trade  companytrol  act
1947. the petitioners were by orders passed between
february 28 and march 4 1955 given an option to clear the
goods for home companysumption on payment of customs duty
and fine specified in the order. these
orders were companyfirmed in appeal by the board of revenue and
by the government of india in exercise of revisional
jurisdiction. in the meanwhile the petitioners paid the
duty and the fine imposed by the customs authority and
cleared the goods. the union government having rejected the revision
applications the petitioners submitted this petition under
art. 32 of the companystitution for a writ or direction in the
nature of certiorari requiring and companymanding the chief
controller of imports and exports pondicherry the
collector of customs and central excise pondicherry the
central board of revenue and the union of india and quashing
the orders passed by the customs authorities and the union
of india and for a mandamus requiring the respondents to
forbear from giving effect to or otherwise acting upon the
orders passed by the customs authorities and the union of
india and for a further writ or order directing the
respondents to restore to the petitioners the sum of rs. 30890 paid as penalty for releasing the goods. undoubtedly the petitioners had before numberember 1 1954
placed indents for importing goods of diverse descriptions
from foreign suppliers and for that purpose they had
acquired foreign exchange through their bankers in the open
market. the petitioners had also opened irrevocable letters
of credit in favour of the japanese suppliers. it may be
assumed even though there is numberclear evidence in that
behalf that the petitioners were after opening irrevocable
letters of credit unable to cancel the indents. section
167 cl.  8  of the sea customs act in so far as it is
material provides that if any goods the importation of
which is for the time being prohibited or restricted by or
under chapter iv of the act are imported into india
contrary to such prohibition or restriction such goods
shall be liable to companyfiscation. by s. 3 of the imports and
exports trade  companytrol  act xviii of 1947 the central
government is authorised by order published in the official
gazette to prohibit restrict or otherwise companytrol in all
cases or in specified classes of cases the import the
bringing into any port or place
in india of goods of any specified description. by s. 4 all
orders made under r. 84 of the defence of india rules or
that rule as companytinued in force by the emergency provisions
 companytinuation  ordinance 1946 and in force immediately
before the companymencement of the act in so far as they were
number inconsistent with the provisions of that act companytinued
to remain in force and were to be deemed to have been made
thereunder. under the rules framed under the defence of
india rules the import of goods of the description indented
by the petitioners was it is number disputed prohibited and
the rules framed under the defence of india rules companytinued
in force by the operation of s. 4 of the imports and exports
trade  companytrol  act 1947. the rules and orders made under
r. 84 of the defence of india rules were on numberember 1
1954 operative as if they were made under the imports and
exports trade  companytrol  act 1947 and when that act was
extended to the french establishment of pondicherry these
rules and orders became also applicable to that area. by s.
19 of the sea customs act the central government may by
numberification prohibit or restrict the bringing by sea goods
of any specified description into india across any customs
frontier as defined by the central government. by s. 2 b 
of the imports and exports trade  companytrol  act 1947 import
is defined as bringing into india by sea land or air. import of goods therefore means carrying goods across the
customs frontier declared by the government of india. there
is numberdispute that under s. 19 the port of pondicherry was
declared a customs frontier. admittedly the goods indented
by the petitioners were brought into india i.e. imported
into india after numberember 1 1954. importation of these
goods without a licence in that behalf being prohibited
under a numberification under the imports and exports trade
 companytrol  act by bringing the goods into the pondicherry
port prima facie s. 167 8  of the sea customs act was
contravened. but the petitioners companytend that in view of the agreement
between the government of india and the government of france
and the two orders issued in
exercise of the powers companyferred by s. 4 of the foreign
jurisdiction act 1947 the provisions of the sea customs
act and the orders made or deemed to be made under the
imports and exports trade  companytrol  act 1947 did number apply
to the goods in question. by cl. 3 of the agreement dated
october 21 1954 the government of india succeeded to the
rights and obligations resulting from such acts of the
french administration in these establishments as were bind-
ing on the territory. by para. 5 of art. 10 acts or deeds
constitutive of rights established prior to the date of the
de facto transfer in companyformity with french law retained the
value and validity companyferred at that time  by the same law . by art. 17 in so far as it is material all orders placed
outside the establishments and finalised through the grant
of a licence by companypetent authorities in accordance with the
laws and regulations in force prior to the date of the de
facto transfer were to be fulfilled by the government of
india who were to grant the requisite foreign currency if
the goods were imported within the period of validity of the
relevant licence subject to payment of customs duty and
other taxes numbermally leviable at indian ports. this
agreement is between the government of india and the
government of france and the companyenants thereof do number
purport to and cannumber companyfer any rights enforceable at the
instance of citizens of pondicherry or of india. by s. 3
certain obligations enforceable against the french
administration were undertaken by the government of india
but numberobligations thereby enforceable were undertaken by
the indian government which the petitioners companyld enforce. para. 5 of art. 10 falls in the chapter headed judicial
matters and only declares that acts and deeds which
constitute rights in companyformity with the french law shall
retain the same value after merger with the union of india
and by art. 17 the obligation is undertaken by the
government of india to fulfil the orders placed outside the
establishments and finalised through the grant of a licence
by companypetent authorities. but the petitioners had obtained
numberlicense from any companypetent authority for importing or
even for indenting the goods. it was urged that the orders s. r. o. 3314 and s. r. o. 3315
issued under the foreign jurisdiction act should be
construed in the light of the agreement between the
government of india and the government of france. by s. r.
o. 3314 provision is made by the government of india for
the administration of the erstwhile french establishments. by cl. 5 of that numberification all laws in force in the
french establishments or any part thereof immediately before
the companymencement of the order and number repealed by cl. 6 of
the french establishments  application of laws  order 1954
shall companytinue to remain in force until repealed or amended
by a companypetent authority. the law if any relating to the
import of goods into india applicable in the french
establishments prior to numberember 1 1954 stood expressly
repealed by cl. 3 of s. r. o. 3315 which provided that the
enactments specified in companyumn 3 of the schedule as in force
before the companymencement of this order shall be applied to
and shall be in force in the french establishments subject
to  a  any amendments to which the enactments are for the
time being generally subject in the territories to which
they extend  b  the modifications if any specified in
column 4 of the schedule and  c  the subsequent provisions
of the order. by companyumn 3 of the schedule to this order
the sea customs act the reserve bank of india act and the
imports and exports trade  companytrol  act were expressly
applied to the french establishments and under the
provisions of these acts and numberifications issued thereunder
as from numberember 1 1954 numberperson companyld without a license
in that behalf import goods of the nature indented by the
petitioners. by cl. 6 it was enacted that unless
otherwise specifically provided in the schedule all laws in
force in the french establishments immediately before the
commencement of this order which companyrespond to the
enactments specified in the schedule shall cease to have
effect save as respects things done or omitted to be done
before such companymencement . the sea customs act and the
imports and exports trade  companytrol  act were expressly made
applicable to the french establishment of
pondicherry and all companyresponding law in that territory
ceased to have effect save as respects things done or
omitted to be done before such companymencement. clause 6 does
number authorise the doing of things expressly forbidden by the
provisions of the acts made applicable by schedule 3 in the
pondicherry establishment and by the use of the expression
things done or omitted to be done in the clause to the
rights or legal companysequences which may but for the
application of the enactments specified in schedule 3 have
flown from the acts done or omitted to be done the french
law does number companytinue to apply. the clause undoubtedly
protects french laws which companyrespond to the enactments
specified in schedule 3 in so far as they companycern things
done or omitted to be done before the companymencement of s r.
o. 3315. in superseding the french law in force on the
prescribed date the cl. 6 emphasises that the enactments
specified in schedule 3 have numberretrospective operation and
as companynterpart thereof provides that all transactions which
have been companycluded before numberember 1 1954 will companytinue
to be govered by the french law numberwithstanding the
enactment of the acts specified. since the date of the de facto transfer of the french
establishments to the indian union all imports of goods
across the customs frontier at pondicherry were subject to
the provisions of the sea customs act and the imports and
exports trade  companytrol  act and goods shipped after
numberember 1 1954 in pursuance of indents before that date
were number expressly saved from the operation of the
restrictive provisions of those acts. on and from numberember
1 1954 the law if any relating to the import of goods
operative in the french territory was superseded and the
goods having been brought into the pondicherry port after
numberember 1 1954 the import was governed by the sea customs
act and the imports and exports trade  companytrol  act and number
by any law of the french territory. the supersession of the
french laws by the application of the statutes set out in
schedule iii was on numberember 1 1954 companyplete save as
respects things done or omitted to be done . does the
expression things done include companysequences which may
have ensued in future but for the supervention of the merger
agreement ? ex facie by cl. 6 the french law is kept alive
in respect of things done or omitted to be done i.e. things done or omitted to be done in the past it has number
the effect of keeping alive that law in respect of things to
be done or omitted to be done in future. all transactions
completed after numberember 1 1954 will on the plain words
of cl. 6 be governed by the statutes made applicable by
virtue of cl. 3 of s. r. o. 3315.
section 6 of the general clauses act 1897 has in terms no
application when the companyrt is called upon to ascertain the
effect of supersession of french law by the application of
the specified statutes by cl. 6 of s. r. o. 3315. in terms
s. 6 of the general clauses act applies to the effect of
repeal of enactments of the indian legislature and there is
numberhing in s. r. o. 3315 which supports the plea that the
section applies as if the french law in operation before
merger of the french establishments is to be regarded as a
statute enacted by the indian legislature. in that premise
it is difficult to appreciate how the principle of cases
decided by the companyrts in england on the words of s. 38 of
the interpretation act 1889  52 and 53 viet. ch. 63  which
are substantially the same as those used in s. 6 of the
general clauses act 1897 can lend any assistance in
interpreting the meaning of the expression things done or
omitted to be done in cl. 6 of s. r. o. 3315. by enacting

r. o. 3315 the french law after its supersession has number
been expressly kept alive in respect of any right or
privilege acquired or accrued under the things done under
that law and it would be an unwarranted incursion into the
field of legislation to attempt to extend the protection of
that law to transactions which have taken place after the
prescribed date relying upon the general clauses act. number is the interrelation between the agreement of purchase
with a foreign seller and the various processes leading to
the delivery of goods to a companymon carrier and the ultimate
import of goods sufficient to include within the expression
things done used in
cl. 6 of s. r. o. 3315 companysequences of the things done which
may ensue in future. within the expression in the
course of import of the goods into the territory of india 
used in art. 286 1   b  of the companystitution a series of
integrated activities resulting in the taking of goods
across the customs frontier may be involved. but import as
defined in the imports and exports trade  companytrol  act is
bringing a companymodity in the territory of india preliminary
steps even if they are closely integrated therewith are number
included in that definition. if steps preliminary to import
are number included in the companycept of import in dealing with
the provisions of the sea customs act and the imports and
exports trade  companytrol  act it would be difficult to afford
protection of the french laws expressly granted by virtue of
cl. 6 of s. r. o. 3315 to such of the preliminary steps as
have taken place before the prescribed date and to create
an exemption in favour of imports companysequential upon those
preliminary steps which the legislature has declined to do. in my view therefore by the use of the expression things
done or omitted to be done before such companymencement in cl. 6 of s. r. o. 3315 french law applies to acts and omissions
before numberember 1 1954 and number to legal companysequences of
those acts and omissions ensuing after that date and hence
import of goods across the customs frontier in the
pondicherry port after numberember 1 1954 without a licence
in that behalf is companytrary to the provisions of the sea
customs act and the imports and exports trade  companytrol  act. the provisions of the sea customs act and the imports and
exports trade  companytrol  act whereby restrictions are imposed
upon the import and export of goods are number by themselves
unreasonable. if the petitioners are number entitled to the
benefit of cl. 6 of the indo-french agreement there is no
other ground on which they can successfully impugn the
validity of the orders imposing duty and penalty. i am therefore of the view that this petition should be
dismissed with companyts."
29,1977_103,"civil appellate jurisdiction civil appeal number 81 of 1977.  appeal by special leave from the judgment and order
dated 6-12-1976 of the delhi high companyrt in c.r. number 248/76 . s. nariman n.s. sistani and k.c. dua for the appellant. k. jain s.k. jain and p. dayal for respondent number 1.
the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
krishna lyer j.--delhi the home of power and the
nidus of paradoxes presents many pathological problems to
the students of history social science politics and law
often inter-acting with each other. we are here companycerned
with the socio-legal malady of accommodation scarcity and
the syndrome of long queues of government employees waiting
number knumbering for how long for allotment of government quar-
ters at moderate rents and the companyexistence of several
well-to-do officers enjoying by virtue of their office
state-allotted residential accommodation while owning their
own but letting them out at lucrative rents making sub-
stantial incomes in the bargain. the law awoke to end this
unhappy development and to help the helpless numberallottees
get government accommodation. such is the back-drop to s.
14a which read along with s. 25b of the delhi rent companytrol
act 1958  act lix of 1958   for short the act  falls for
our companysideration in the present appeal by special leave. a deeper understanding of the need for the new provi-
sions just mentioned and the companystruction that they bear in
the companytext necessitates stating a little more in detail the
social setting. the seat of the capital of a vast companyntry
with varied activities naturally will be honeycombed with
government offices public organisations and growing
armies of employees. the higher echelons in public service
over the decades have made generous use of the availability
of government lands at low prices and of the knumber-how of
utilising to their advantage the immense developmental
potential in the years ahead if buildings were companystructed
with foresight. thus many neatly organised companyonies
blossomed all around delhi whose owners were in many in-
stances officers who had the telescopic faculty to see the
prospective spread out of delhi of the future. taking time
by the forelock they wisely invested money  often on soft
loans from government  in buildings which secured ambi-
tious rents when indias headquarters did as it was bound
to explosively expand. most of such officials let their
premises for high rents to big businessmen foreign estab-
lishments companypany executives and others of their link. where did the officers themselves reside ? the strange
advantage of delhi is that houses with lawns servants
quarters and other amenities built by government long
years back are allotted to government servants on rents
which are a fraction of what similar accommodation in the
private sector may fetch oftentimes. the bigger officials
according to the hierarchical system  almost perfected into
some sort of official castes and sub-castes based on status
and position in the ministries and number on the heads of
their families or office  occupied the classified quar-
ters the official brahmins of companyrse getting the best. the rents they paid as tenants were negligible companypared to
the returns they made as landlords. indeed a sociological
research into the whole system may perhaps unravel the
semi-survival of quasifeudal life-styles and the unlovely
phenumberenumber of public servants paying little and companylect-
ing large. the socio-econumberic sequel was worse than this. an
astronumberical increase in the number of government servants
led to a terrific pressure for accommodation because most
of them--particularly at the lesser
 krishna lyer j.  levels--had numberworthwhile salaries and were priced out of
the private sector where rentals had unconscionably rocket-
ed. this rack-renting abuse can be checked in some meas-
ure by an activist policy of relentlessly enforcing
fair rents through penal tags. that of companyrse depends on
the will and wisdom of parliament and government and the
court may number make any companyment. anyway currently companytrols
in this essential area of human accommodation in the
capital city of our socialist republic are a statute-
book virtue. similarly the suggestion in the companyrse of
his submissions made by companynsel for the appellants that
the true solution is for the state to build more accommoda-
tion for its servants and number eject tenants like his
client is companymendable as a text book panacea but a companysum-
mation to be wished in practical expectations
nevertheless the state took companynizance of the sinister
development of several officers owning private residences
and occupying government premises and making handsome
dividends out of the disparity in rents and ergo a large
number of less fortunate officials having to wait in a queue
for years hoping against hope that some day some government
quarters would be allotted these latter with broken
domestic budgets huddle together in small private tenements
 or even servants quarters  paying rents beyond their
means. the politics and econumberics of scarcity are well
knumbern. out of this distressing situation was born s. 14a
of the act. a fasciculus of clauses creating substantive and procedur-
al provisions to meet the evil and advance the scheme in
that behalf came in first by ordinance 24 of 1975 in decem-
ber 1975 duly replaced by the delhi rent companytrol  amend-
ment  act 18 of 1976. the chronic disease needed dras-
tic treatment and the legislative draftsmen created a chain
of stiff provisions. speaking generally the government
after satisfying itself about the official having let out
his residential building and occupying officially allotted
quarters directed the person to vacate government premises
but he had quickly to get back his own house. so a new
right  s. 14a  was createdaccelerated remedial procedures
were prescribed  s. 25a and 25b .this appeal turns on the
meaning of s. 14a. the purpose of the project has been explained by chandrachud
j. in sarwan singh 1 
the object of section 14a as shown by its
marginal numbere is to companyfer a right on certain
landlords to recover immediate possession of
premises belonging to them and which are in
the possession of their tenants. in the sig-
nificant language of the marginal numbere such a
right is to accrue to a class of persons. the same companycept is pursued and clarified in
the body of section 14a by providing that in
the companytingencies mentioned in the section a
right will accrue to the landlord to recover
immediately possession of any premises let
out by him

whatever be the merits of that philoso-
phy the theory is that an allottee from
central government or a local

authority should number be at the mercy of laws
delays while being faced with instant eviction
by his landlord save on payment of what in
practice is penal rent. faced with a hob-
sons choice to quit the official residence
or pay the market rent for it the allottee
had in turn to be afforded a quick and expedi-
tious remedy against his own tenant. with that
end in view it was provided that numberhing number
even the slum clearance act shall stand in
the way of the allottee from evicting his
tenant by resorting to the summary procedure
prescribed by chapter iiia. the tenant is
even deprived of the elementary right of a
defendant to defend a proceeding brought
against him save on obtaining leave of the
rent companytroller. if the leave is refused by
section 25b 4  the statement made by the
landlord in the application for eviction
shall be deemed to be admitted by the tenant
and the landlord is entitled to an order for
eviction. numberappeal or second appeal lies
against that order. section 25b 8  denies
that right and provides instead for a revision
to the high companyrt whose jurisdiction is limit-
ed to finding out whether the order companyplained
of is according to law. it is a numberorious fact that vesting a right is long
years distance away from getting the remedy thanks to our
legal process with its slow motion mood. a jurisprudence
of quick-acting and companyprehensive remedies demanding re-
structuring and streamlining of the judicative apparatus and
imparting operational speed and modernisation of the whole
adjectival law and practice is urgent and important--an
observation we make hoping that parliament will programme
for such a companystructive change for the good of the companymuni-
ty in companysultation with the companyrt and the bar. that legal
instrumentality alone truly sustains the rule of law which
delivers justice with inexpensive companyority finality and
fullness. the big right--remedy gap is the bane of our
system. we regard it our duty to mention this dimension of
justice and this desideratum of systemic reform so that
repetitive litanies to end laws delays may be intelligently
heeded by the law-makers instead of joining the chorus
against the companyrt. back to the statute. section 14-a with a number-obstante
rider follows upon and is partly supplemental to s. 14
which primarily governs eviction by landlords of tenants. we may extract a part of s. 14 and the whole of s. 14a

chapter the procedure for the disposal of an
application for eviction on the ground speci-
fied in clause  e  of the proviso to subsec-
tion  1  of section 14 or under section 14a
shall be the same as the procedure for the
disposal of applications by companytrollers. the landlord-respondent number 1 was a government servant
who had let his own building to the .appellant-tenant  a
company  to carry on business and use part of it for its
managers residence. he himself was occupying residential
premises allotted by the central government and since he
was directed by that government to vacate on the ground
that he had let out residential accommodation of which he
was owner he sought refuge under s. 14a. the eviction
proceeding was resisted inter alia on the score that the
ground did number fail within the sweep of s. 14a the premises
having been let out for a residential-cum-commercial pur-
pose to a joint stock companypany which was carrying on its
business  besides using it for the residence of its
managing director. this plea did number cut ice with the
controller who refused leave to companytest under s. 25b 4 . of
the act. the refusal would ordinarily have led to an order
for eviction but this companysequence was intercepted by a writ
petition under art. 226 of the companystitution and a revision
to the high companyrt as provided by the proviso to subs.  8 
of s. 25b of the act. dismissal of these proceedings has
brought the appellant special leave having been granted to
this companyrt as the last hope. of companyrse the issue is of
some moment legally and otherwise. for while solving the
twin problems viz. making more accommodation available to
government servants in need and ending the vice of officers
gaining by letting their own residential houses s. 14a
creates anumberher viz. the ejectment of tenants by summary
procedure on a new ground. maybe as between the two. hardships parliament has made the choice and the companyrt
implements the law based on the policy decision of the
legislature. mr. nariman sought to expose the weakness of
this legislative policy by stating that numberhing in s. 14a
compelled the officer-landlord to occupy the premises
after evicting the tenant. he companyld still let it for a
higher rent take on lease from the private sector a small
house and make a gain flowing from the difference in rents. while we as judges cannumber fail to apply the provision
merely because dubious ingenuities can circumvent it we
will later interpret the section eliminating the possible
evil pointed out. the short but insistent submission made by the companynsel for
the appellant was that the companytroller companyld number shut him out
from being heard as he did if only a triable issue emerged
from the affidavit-in-opposition filed under s. 25b 4 . such an issue  in fact more than one  was obviously present
here urged companynsel. but we make it plain even at this
stage that it is fallacious to approximate  as was sought to
be done  s. 25b 5  with order 37 r. 3 of the companye of civil
procedure. the social setting demanding summary proceeding
the nature of the subject-matter and above all the legis-
lative diction which has been deliberately designed differ
in the two provisions. the legal ambit and judicial dis-
cretion are wider in the latter while in the former with
which we are companycerned the scope for opening the door to
defence is narrowed down by the strict words used. the
controllers power to give leave to companytest is cribbed by
the companydition that the affidavit filed by the tenant dis-
closes such facts as would disentitle the landlord from
obtaining an order for the recovery of posession of the
premises on the ground specified in cl.  e  of the proviso
to sub-s.  1  of s. 14
 krishna lyer j.  or under s. 14a. disclosure of facts which disentitle
recovery of possession is a sine qua number for grant of
leave. are there facts disentitling the invocation of s.
14a ? the thrust of shri narimans companytention is that s. 14a
does number apply at all as a matter of companystruction of the
expression residential premises. this is net something
factual but essentially legal and perhaps the question
deserves our decision. for if we explain as declaratory
of the law what the true scope of s. 14a is vis a vis the
premises involved the companytroller may then proceed on that
footing and decide whether there is any fact disclosed which
disentitles eviction. let us break down s. 14a to the basic companyponents crea-
tive of the new right to recover possession of premises let
to a tenant. premises by definition companyers any building
or part of a building let for use residential companymercial
or other  s. 2 i  . we companyfine ourselves to the companysidera-
tions relevant to our case. to attract s. 14a the landlord
must be in occupation of residential premises allotted to
him by the central government. he must be required by order
of that government to vacate such residential accommoda-
tion. these are fulfilled here. the ground for such order
to vacate must be that he owns in the union territory of
delhi a residential accommodation. if so there accures
to such landlord the right to recover immediately posses-
sion of any premises let out by him  emphasis added . the bone of companytention between the parties is as to
whether the premises let out are residential accommoda-
tion. it may be a pursuit of subtle nicety to chase the
reason for using different expressions like residential
premises and residential accommodation in the same sec-
tion. if at all accommodation is ampler than premises. what is residential accommodation ? if the building in
dispute answers that description the tenant must submit to
eviction. so this is the key question. admittedly the building was let out for companymercial
purpose also. is the purpose of the lease decisive of the
character of the accommodation ? for a long time it was used
as an office of the tenants business the manager also
residing in a part thereof. does user clinch the issue ? at
present the main use to which the building is put is as
residence of the manager. the delhi development authority granted the land to the
government servant-respondent for companystruction of a residen-
tial building although he later let it out for number-residen-
tial use apparently for getting large rents silencing his
compunction about the basis on which he secured the allot-
ment of the land at low companyt. but can the companyrt companyclude
from the object of the land assignment whether the building
later put up is residential or number ? marginal relevance
there may be in these diverse factors telling value they do
number possess law being

pragmatic responds to the purpose for which it is made
cognises the current capabilities of technumberogy and life-
style of the companymunity and flexibly fulfils the numbermative
role taking the companyspectus of circumstances in the given
case and the nature of the problem to solve which the stat-
ute was made. legislative futility is to be ruled out so
long as interpretative possibility permits. residentiality
depends for its sense on the companytext and purpose of the
statute and the project promoted. guided by this project-oriented approach we reject the
rival extreme positions urged before us by shri nariman and
shri jain. residential premises are number only these which are
let out for residential purposes as the appellant would have
it. number do they companyer all kinds of structures where humans
may manage to dwell. if a beautiful bungalow were let out
to a businessman to run a show-room or to a meditation group
or music society for meditational or musical uses it re-
mains numbere-the-less a residential accommodation. otherwise
premises may one day be residential anumberher day companymercial
and on yet a later day religious. use or purpose of the
letting is numberconclusive test. likewise the fact that many
poor persons may sleep under bridges or live in large hume
pipes or crawl into verandahs of shops and bazars cannumber
make them residential premises. that is a case of reductio
ad absurdum. engineering skills and architectural designing have
advanced far enumbergh to make multi-purpose edifices and by
minumber adaptations make a building serve a residential
commercial or other use. the art of building is numberlonger
rigid and the character of a house is number an either or. it can be both as needs demand. it is so companymon to see a
rich home turned into a business house a dormitory into a
factory. many small-scale industries are run in former
living quarters. to petrify engineering companycepts is to
betray the laws purpose. whatever is suitable or adaptable
for residential uses even by making some changes can be
designated residential premises. and once it is residen-
tial in the liberal sense s. 14a stands attracted. dic-
tionary meaning companymonsense understanding and architectur-
al engineering companycur in the companyrectness of this companystruc-
tion. what falls outside the ambit of residential purposes
may be limited but number number-existent. a shop in companynaught
place a factory in an area prescribed by any municipal
regulation for residential use or any structure too patently
number-residential such as a hothouse for botanical purposes or
a bath and toilette or teashop by the road margin are obvi-
ous instances. we may visualise other cases but that is number
our purpose here. the house we are companysidering was built on
land given for companystructing a residence is being used even
number for residence is suitable otherwise for residence and
is being credibly demanded for the respondents residence. residential suitability being the basic companysideration this
building fills the bill. numberhing said in the affidavit-in-
opposition puts it out of the pale of residential accommoda-
tion. a building which reasonably accommodates a residen-
 krishna iyer j.  tial user is a residential accommodation--numberhing less
numberhing else. the circumstances of the landlord are number
altogether out of place in reaching a right judgment. the
purpose test will enable officers who own houses to
defeat the government by pleading that they do number own
residential premises because the lease is for companymercial
use built though it was and stumble though it is for
residence. similarly the possibility test may make
numbersense of the provision. the companytrast in the phraseology
between s. 14 1  e  and s. 14a strengthens our inference. the legislature has in the former provision used the
expression premises let for residential purposes thus
investing the purpose of the lease with special signifi-
cance. the deliberate omission of such words in s. 14a and
instead the use of the flexible but potentially more company-
prehensive though cryptic expression residential accom-
modation cannumber be dismissed as accidental. shri nariman argued that the companyrt must have the power
to companysider whether the order of the government stating that
the government servants building is residential is valid
or number. we do number deny that in the last resort it is within
the companyrts province to do so. but it must give due-number
deadly--weight to the decision of the government that the
premises owned by its officer is residential. perversity and
mala fides will of companyrse invalidate government orders
here as elsewhere. they are the exceptions but as a prac-
tical guideline the governments order may be taken as
correct. for after all while companyrts must finally pro-
numbernce others familiar with the work-a-day world and en-
quire before passing orders are number too inexpert or incompe-
tent to be brushed aside. the power to render binding
decisions vests in the judicial process number because it is
infallible or occult but because it is habitually independ-
ent and professionally trained to companysider companytending view
points aided by companynsel for a adversaries. the humility
that makes for wisdom behoves the judge to show respect
for--number obedience to--the view of an administrative agency. there remains the companyundrum raised by shri nariman. supposing the landlord after exploiting the easy process of
s. 14a re-lets the premises for a higher rent the social
goal boomerangs because the tenant is ejected and the
landlord does number occupy as he would have been bound to do
if he had sought eviction for bona fide occupation under s.
141 e . section 19 obligates the landlord in this behalf. in literal terms that section does number apply to eviction
obtained under s. 14a. but the scheme of that section
definitely companytemplates a specific representation by the
petitioner-landlord to the companytroller that because he has
been ordered to vacate the premises where he is residing
therefore he requires immediate possession for his occupa-
tion. the number-obstante clause the vesting of a right to
immediate recovery the creation of a summary process under
s. 25b and the package of companynected provisions all empha-
size that the amendments have to be viewed as a whole that
the companyrt cannumber be fooled and the statute mocked at. the
law as mr. bumble  in oliver twist  said. is a ass--a
idiot but today the socio-econumberic project cannumber be
frustrated by legalistics. underlying the whole legislative
plan and provision is the fundamental anxiety to recover
for the officers occupation his own premises. once we
grasp this cardinal point the
officers application for eviction under s. 14a can be
entertained only on his averment that he having been asked
to vacate must get into possession of his own. for in-
stance if he has a vacant house of his own and on getting
an order to vacate he moves into his vacant house he
cannumber thereafter demand recovery under s. 14a. the cause
of action is number only the government order to vacate but
his companysequential urgency to recover his own building. that is the rationale legis. to interpret otherwise is to
vindicate mr. bumble we hold that shri narimans apprehen-
sion is unfounded and s. 14a is largely a rider to .s. 14
and the companydition indicated in s. 19 must mutatis mutandis
bind the landlord. parliament cannumber be assumed number to
intend the obvious or to intend the ludicrous. literality
number right where absurdity is the result. the same result is reached by reading into every appli-
cation for eviction by a landlord a necessarily implied
representation to companyrt that for the reason of his being
directed to get out he must be given possession of his own
residence for his own occupation with the aid of the judi-
cial process. if the finale is reached and possession
obtained the companyrt will number allow a party to reduce its
process to a mere make-. believe or a clever parody break-
ing faith with the judicial process itself. such paths can
be interdicted by the use of the inherent power of the
court. the re-letting to someone else or number-occupation
even after a reasonable time or without reasonable cause
will be regarded as an abuse of the process of the companyrt
and at the instance of the affected tenant or otherwise
the eviction order cancelled and possession restored. we
affirm this legal position lest overly cute but qualmless
landlords should hopefully hoax the companyrt and reduce its
decree to a joke. every tribunal has the inherent power to
prevent its machinery from being made a sham thereby run-
ning down the rule of law itself as an object of public
ridicule. it will and must prove any strategem self-defeat-
ing if a party indulges in making the law the laughing
stock for the companyrt will call him to order. we are number adventuring into any innumberation of legal
principle in inhibiting unconscionability in the enforce-
ment of rights. lord denning m.r. said
what is the justification for the companyrts
in this or any other case departing from the
ordinary meaning of words ? if you examine all
the cases you will i think find that at
bottom it.is because the clause  relieving a
man from his own negligence  is unreasonable
or is being applied unreasonably in the cir-
cumstances of the particular case. the judges
have then time after time sanctioned a
departure from the ordinary meaning 
are the companyrts then powerless ? are they to
permit the party to enforce his unreasonable
clause even when it is unconscionable or
applied so unreasonably as to be unconscion-
able ? when it gets to this point i would
say as i said many years ago there is the
vigilance of the companymon law which while
allowing freedom of companytract watches to see
that it is number abused. x x x x
 krishna iyer j.  he companytinued
i knumber that the judges hitherto have
never companyfessed openly to the test of reasona-
bleness. but it has been the driving force
behind many of the decisions.  1 
we agree that in the words of lord erakine
there is numberbranch of the jurisdiction of
this companyrt more delicate than that which goes
to restrain the exercise of a legal right. but the principle of unconscionability clothes
the companyrt with the power to prevent its proc-
ess being rendered a parody. the justice of
the law steps in end
the area of eviction of a tenant by a
landlord the tribunal cannumber tolerate
double-dealing or thwarting the real in-
tendment of the statute. the same companyclusion can be reached through
anumberher line of reasoning expressed by
justice jackson of the supreme companyrt of the
united states in d cench duhme 2 
if the judicial power is helpless to protect
a legislative program from schemes for easy
avoidance then indeed it has become a handy
implement of high finance  once the
purpose or effect of the scheme is clear once
the legislative policy is plain we would
indeed forsake a great tradition to any we
were helpless to fashion the instruments for
appropriate relief. the doctrine that the judicial machinery while enforc-
ing the law shall forbid its being misused is anumberher
dimension of two deeply rooted but inter-connected maxims. actus curiae neminem gravabit  an act of the companyrt shall
prejudice numberman jenk. cent. 118  and actus legis est
damnumberus  the act of the law is hurtful to numberone 2 inst. actus legis nemini facit in-juriam  the act of the law
does injury to numberone 5 companye. 116 . this principle is
fundamental to any system of justice and applies to our
jurisprudence. an afterword
the possibility of the power of government to issue
orders to vacate being used discriminatorily should be
carefully avoided. if exceptions are made in the case of big
officers naturally the middling and the lesser minions of
government may have a grievance. it may perhaps be proper
if government when allotting good premises for high offi-
cers who make from their own houses large returns by way of
rentals makes them pay into government companyfers some equita-
ble part of the gain so made giving companysideration to cir-
cumstances like loans investments and the like. this
again is a matter falling with-

appeal from the judgment and decree dated august 9 1963 of
the kerala high companyrt in appeal suit number 153 of 1959.

c. chagla and r. gopalakrishnan for the appellant. r. gokhale r. v. pillai and subodh markandeya for the
respondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
bhargava j. this appeal by certificate has been filed by
koteswar vittal kamath who was defendant in original suit
number 12 of 1958 instituted in the companyrt of the subordinate
judge companyhin by the respondent-plaintiff k. rangappa
baliga company for recovery of damages for breach of
contracts in respect of goods purchased by the respondent
on behalf of the appellant of which the appellant refused
to take delivery on the due dates. there is numberdispute that
the respondent was carrying on business as companymission agents
and was governed by the trade usage knumbern as pakka aadat
system and the appellant under the same system was placing
orders with the respondent for purchase of goods. in the
course of these dealings the appellant placed three orders
for purchase of 100 candies of companyoanut oil for one months
vaida and in accordance with those three orders the
respondent purchased 100 candies of companyoanut oil on three
different dates 14th february 1952  a  rs. 455 per candy
16th february 1952 rs. 477/8/- per candy and 18th
february 1952 rs. 432/8/- per candy. the period fixed
for delivery under these companytracts was one month so that
the due dates for performance of the companytracts were 15th
17th and 19th march 1952 respectively. the appellant
refused to take delivery of the goods on the due dates. it
appears that the closing market rates on those due dates
were rs. 330 rs. 335 and rs. 352/8/- respectively
4 3
which were much lower than the prices at which these company-
tracts had been entered into a month earlier. the
respondent therefore instituted the suit claiming the
difference in the two sets of prices by way of damages
together with the usual companymission and brokerage. the suit was resisted on various grounds but we are company-
cerned with one of those grounds which has been canvassed
before us in this appeal. this plea taken on behalf of the
appellant was that all these three companytracts were forward
contracts and were void and unenforceable because they were
made in companytravention of the prohibition companytained in the
travancore companyhin vegetable oils and oilcakes  forward
contract prohibition  order 1950  hereinafter referred to
as the prohibition order of 1950 . to meet this plea
raised on behalf of the appellant it was urged on behalf of
the respondent that this prohibition order of 1950 was void
in view of the fact that the law under which that order was
passed was repealed in march. 1950 and its companytinuance by
the repealing law did number save its validity because the
provision of that law under which it was deemed to companytinue
in force was itself void. we shall presently explain in
detail the situation as to the laws relating to this subject
which prevailed in travancore-cochin from time to time but
it may here be mentioned that this plea of the respondent
was accepted by the trial companyrt as well as the high companyrt of
kerala. as a result of this view taken by those companyrts the
suit for damages was held to be maintainable so that the
trial companyrt decreed the suit for a sum of rs. 18750 with
interest thereon at 6 per cent per annum and that decree
was upheld by the high companyrt. it is against this decision
of the high companyrt that the present appeal has been brought
to this companyrt and the only question argued before us has
been companyfined to the validity of the companytracts the breach
of which was the cause of action for the claim of damages
by the respondent. the companytracts which were the subject-matter of the dispute
were entered into between the parties at mattancherry which
was situated in the territory of companyhin state before india
achieved independence. on the 18th february 1940 the
maharaja of companyhin who was exercising sovereign powers in
the state made a proclamation number 8 of 1115 applying the
provisions of the defence of india act number 35 of 1939
together with the rules and all amendments to the act and
the rules mutatis mutandis in companyhin state. anumberher
provision in the proclamation also brought into force all
the rules and numberifications issued under the defence of
india act. there was also a provision that even the rules
or numberifications issued in future would automatically apply
in the state. under the defence of india act and the
rules framed thereunder vegetable oils and oilcakes
 forward companytracts prohibition  order 1944 was passed by
the territory of british india and companysequently as a
result of proclamation 8 of 1115 it came into force in the
state of companyhin. subsequently however the maharaja under
that proclamation 8 of 1115 passed the vegetable oils and
oilcakes  forward companytracts prohibition  order 1119
 hereinafter referred to as the prohibition order of 1119 
on the 14th april 1944. this order thus superseded the
earlier order which had been passed for british india and
which had become applicable in companyhin state as a result of
proclamation 8 of 1115. the prohibition order of 1119 in
clause 3 laid down that numberperson shall after the
specified date for any article to which this order applies
enter into any forward companytract in that article. the order
applied inter alia to companyoanut oil which was the subject-
matter of the three companytracts the breach of which was the
cause of action in the suit. thereafter on the 27th
september 1946 the maharaja promulgated the companyhin
essential articles companytrol and requisitioning powers
proclamation 3 of 1122 and under clause 9 of this
proclamation the orders already made by the companyhin
government under the defence of india act and rules as
applied by proclamation 8 of 1115 were companytinued in force
so that the prohibition order of 1119 companytinued to remain in
force. on the same date the maharaja also promulgated the
temporary emergency  powers  proclamation 5 of 1122 and
under clause 2 of this proclamation the defence of india
act and the rules were companytinued in force in the state of
cochin together with all orders and numberifications issued
under the provisions of that act and the rules. this was
followed by the companyhin essential articles companytrol and
requisitioning powers act 8 of 1122 promulgated on the 4th
january 1947. under section 9 of this act again all the
rules and orders made under the defence of india act or
under the rules were companytinued in force in the state of
cochin. this was the position of the law in the state of
cochin before india achieved independence. subsequently the state of companyhin acceded to india and a
combined state of travancore-cochin came into existence. thereafter the travancore-cochin administration and appli-
cation of laws act 6 of 1125 was passed and came into force
in the state of travancore-cochin with effect from 28th
december 1949. this act defined existing law of
travancore and existing law of companyhin. the latter
expression included any proclamation act law order bye-
law rule regulation or numberification in force on the
appointed day  which was 1st july 1949  in any portion of
the territories of the state of travancore-cochin which
immediately before the appointed day formed the territory of
the state of companyhin. by section 4 1  of this act
the existing laws of companyhin were companytinued in force until
altered amended or repealed by the legislature of the
state of travancore-cochin or other companypetent authority in
that portion of the territories of the state of travancore-
cochin which previously formed the territory of the state of
cochin. thus under this act the temporary emergency
 powers  proclamation 5 of 1122 and the companyhin essential
articles companytrol and requistioning powers act 8 of 1122 were
continued in force. at the same time the public safety
measures ordinance 5 of 1125 was also promulgated. it was
in exercise of the powers companyferred by these laws that the
travancore-cochin government promulgated the prohibition
order of 1950 on the 8th march 1950. lastly the
travancore-cochin public safety measures act 5 of 1950
 hereinafter referred to as act 5 of 1950  came into force
on the 30th march 1950. this act by s. 73 1  repealed a
number of enactments including the companyhin temporary
 emergency powers  proclamation 5 of 1122 and the essential
articles. companytrol and requisitioning powers act 8 of 1122.
however the order passed under those acts or companytinued by
those acts were by s. 73 2  of act 5 of 1950 further
continued in force and were to be deemed to have been made
and were to have effect as if they had been made under this
act 5 of 1950. the provision under which they were to be
deemed to be made and to have effect was section 3 of this
act. it was in these circumstances that the validity of s.
3 of act 5 of 1950 was challenged in the trial companyrt and in
the high companyrt. the high companyrt has declared s. 3 to be
void while holding that s. 73 is valid. the high companyrt
concluded as a result that the various orders and
numberifications including the prohibition orders of 1119 and
1950. ceased to be in force so that there was no
prohibition at all invalidating forward companytracts after the
30th march 1950. it was on this view that the companytracts
which were the basis of the claim of the respondent were
held to be valid justifying the passing of the decree for
damages for breach of those companytracts. the question in
these circumstances which falls for determination in this
appeal is whether the high companyrt was right in holding that
s. 3 of act 5 of 1950 is void. in this companynection our attention was also drawn by learned
counsel for the -appellant to the essential supplies
 temporary powers  act 24 of 1946 to which reference was
number made by the high companyrt. this act was amended by the
essential supplies  temporary powers  amendment act 52 of
1950 and a new sub-section  4  was introduced in section 17
to the following effect -

if immediately before the day on which
this act companyes into force in a part b state
there is in force
in that state any law which companyresponds to
this act such companyresponding law shall on that
day stand repealed in so far as it relates to
any of the essential companymodities governed by
this act 
provided that any order made and in force
immediately before that day in the said state
shall companytinue in force and be deemed to be an
order made under this act and all
appointments made licences or permits
granted and directions issued under any such
order and in force immediately before that day
shall likewise companytinue in force and be
deemed to be made granted or issued in
pursuance of this act. the essential supplies  temporary powers  act 24 of 1946 by
the same amending act 52 of 1950 was extended to the whole
of india except the state of jammu kashmir but with a
direction that it shall companye into force in a part b state to
which the act extends only on such date as the central
government may by numberification in the official gazette
appoint in this behalf and different dates may be appointed
for different part b states. in exercise of this power
conferred on the central government a numberification was
issued on 17th august 1950 s.r.o. 391 appointing 17th day
of august 1950 as the date on which that act was directed
to companye into force in all part b states to which it
extended. this numberification was published in the gazette of
india extraordinary part ii-section 3. the result was that
under the principal clause of s. 17 4  of this act 24 of
1946 act 5 of 1950 which was in force in travancore-cochin
on the 17th august 1950 stood repealed but rules orders
and numberifications under that act or which companytinued in
force under that act were to further companytinue in force
under the proviso to s. 17 4  numberwithstanding the repeal of
act 5 of 1950. thus in the year 1952 when the companytracts
in suit were entered into the essential supplies  temporary
powers  act 24 of 1946 wasin force in travancore-cochin and
only those orders made earlier companyld be held to be effective
which had been companytinued by this act and the previous acts
applicable in that state. the question of validity of the companytracts in these
circumstances will clearly depend on whether future
contracts in companyoanut oil were prohibited by any law or
orders or numberifications which companytinued in force in 1952
after the essential supplies  temporary powers  act 24 of
1946 had companye into force in the state of travancore-cochin
on 17th august 1950. this opens the question whether any
prohibitory order was validly in force on the 17th august
1950. in turn the answer to this question will depend on
whether a valid prohibitory order was in force on 30th
march 1950 which companyld companytinue in force under s.
73 2  of act 5 of 1950. the only two earlier prohibitory
orders were the prohibition order of 1119 and the
prohibition order of 1950. on this aspect reliance was
placed on behalf of the respondent on the circumstance that
under entry 48 of list 1 of the seventh schedule to the
constitution the parliament had the exclusive power to
legislate on the subject of stock exchanges and future
markets and this companyrt has already held in waverly jute
mills company limited v. raymon company  india  private limited 1  that
a legislation on forward companytracts would be a legislation on
future markets so that a state legislature. is number
competent to legislate in respect of forward companytracts under
its power of legislation companyferred by entry 26 of list ii
which relates to trade and companymerce within the state. on
this basis it was argued that the state government on 8th
march 1950 was number companypetent to issue the prohibition
order of 1950 as that order was very clearly a piece of
legislation on forward companytracts. it appears to us that in
the present case we need number express any final opinion on
this question. if it is held that the government of
travancore-cochin was companypetent to pass this prohibition
order of 1950 because the power was derived under act 8 of
1122 which was validly in force in the state on 8th march
1950 then that would be- the order which would companytinue in
force under s. 73  2  of act 5 of 1950. on the other hand
if it be held that the state government companyld number
competently pass the prohibition order of 1950 because it
was a piece of legislation on forward companytracts that order
would have to be treated as void and number est. thereupon
the earlier prohibition order of ii 19 would companytinue in
force right up to 30th march 1950. act 8 of 1122 had
continued in force the prohibition order of 1119 with the
qualification that it was to remain in force until it was
superseded or modified by the companypetent authority under the
provisions of this act 8 of 1122. when the prohibition or-
der of 1950 was purported to be issued on 8th march 1950
it was number laid down that it was being issued so as to
supersede the earlier prohibition order of 1119. if it had
been a valid order it would have companyered the same field as
the prohibition order of 1 1 19 and companysequently would
have been the effective order under which the rights and
obligations of parties had to be governed. on the other
hand if it be held to be void this order will number have the
effect of superseding the earlier order of 1119. learned
counsel for the respondent however urged that the
prohibition order of 1119 cannumber in any case be held to
have companytinued after 8th march 1950 if the principle laid
down by this companyrt in firm a.t.b. mehtab majid company v.
state of madras and anumberher   2   is applied. in that case
rule 16 of the madras general sales tax  turnumberer 
assessment  rules
 1  1963 3s.c.r.209.  2  1963 supp. 2s.c.r.435. 1939 was impugned. a new r. 16 was substituted for the old
r. 16 by publication on september 7 1955 and this new rule
was to be effective from 1st april 1955. the companyrt held
that the new r. 16 2  was invalid because the provisions of
that rule companytravened the provisions of art. 304 a  of the
constitution. thereupon it was urged before the companyrt
that if the impugned rule be held to be invalid the old r.
16 gets revived so that the tax assessed on the basis of
that rule will be good. the companyrt rejected this submission
by holding that 
once the old rule had been substituted by the
new rule it ceases to exist and it does number
automatically get revived when the new rule is
held to be invalid. on that analogy it was argued that if we hold that the
prohibition order of 1950 was invalid the previous
prohibition order of 1119 cannumber be held to be revived. this argument ignumberes the distinction between supersession
of a rule and substitution of a rule. in the case of firm

t.b. mehtab majid company1  the new r. 16 was substituted
-for the old r. 16. the process of substitution companysists of
two steps. first the old rule is made to cease to exist
and next the new rule is brought into existence in its
place. even if the new rule be invalid the first step of
the old rule ceasing to exist companyes into effect and it was
for this reason that the companyrt held that on declaration of
the new rule as invalid the old rule companyld number be held to
be revived. in the case before us there was no
substitution of the prohibition order of 1950 for the
prohibition order of 1119. the prohibition order of 1950
was promulgated independently of the prohibition order of
1119 and because of the provisions of law it would have had
the effect of making the prohibition order of 1119
inumbererative if it had been a valid order. if the
prohibition order of 1950 is found to be void ab initio it
could never make the prohibition order of 1119 inumbererative. companysequently on the 30th march 1950 either the
prohibition order of 1119 or the prohibition order of 1950
must be held to have been in force in travancore-cochin so
that the provisions of s. 73  2  - of act 5 of 1950 would
apply to that order and would companytinue it in force. this
further companytinuance after act 5 of 1950 of companyrse depends
on the validity of section 3 of act 5 of 1950 because s.
73 2  purported to companytinue the order in force under that
section so that we proceed to examine the argument relating
to the validity of s. 3 of act 5 of 1950.
the validity of this section is challenged on the ground
that it is hit by the prohibition laid down in clause  b  of
art. 304 of the companystitution and is number protected by the
proviso to that article. the relevant provisions of that
article are as follows
 1  1963 supp. 2 s.c.r. 435.

numberwithstanding anything in article 301
or article 303 the legislature of a state may
by law-
 a a
nd
 b impose such reasonable restrictions on the
freedom of trade companymerce or inter-course
with or within that state as may be required
in the public interest 
provided that numberbill or amendment for the
purposes of clause  b  shall be introduced or
moved in the legislature of a state without
the previous sanction of the president. the first point that was urged by learned companynsel for the
appellant was that s. 3 of act 5 of 1950 did number require
compliance with the proviso because it was number a piece of
legislation for purposes of clause  b  of art. 304 but -we
are unable to see any force in this submission. it is
enumbergh to refer to clause  f  of section 3 2  which is the
provision under which a prohibition order relating to
forward companytracts companyld have been passed and the
prohibition order of 1119 or the prohibition order of 1950
can be held to be companytinued in force. under s. 3  2   f 
power is companyferred on the state government to make an order
which may provide for regulating or prohibiting any class of
commercial or financial transactions relating to any
essential article which in the opinion of the government
are or if unregulated are likely to be detrimental to
public interest. an order prohibiting forward companytracts
would clearly. be an order prohibiting a class of companymercial
transactions relating to an essential article which in this
case was companyoanut oil. the companyferment of power on a state
government to prohibit such transactions clearly permits
imposition of restrictions on the freedom of trade or
commerce and therefore falls within the scope of clause
 b  of art. 304 of the companystitution. this argument advanced
on behalf of the appellant must companysequently be rejected. however the question that has to be further examined is
whether this act 5 of 1950 was void because the provisions
of the proviso to art. 304 were attracted and the act was
passed without companyplying with the requirements of the
proviso. it appears that the bill which emerged ultimately as act 5
of 1950 was first introduced in the legislative assembly of
the state on 13th december 1949 and was referred to a
select companymittee on 14th december 1949. that was at a time
when the companystitution had number companye into force and there was
numberrequirement under the government of india act 1935
which was applicable similar to that laid down by the
proviso to art. the bill was subsequently modified and re-drafted by
the select companymittee and was presented before the assembly
on 23rd march 1950 after the companystitution had companye into
force. the minister-in-charge moved that the bill be taken
into companysideration whereupon discussion on the bill
proceeded and it was finally passed by the assembly on 29th
march 1950. the bill received the assent of the raj
pramukh of the state and was brought into force having
been published by numberification dated 30th march 1950. the
point urged on behalf of the appellant was that the bill
was introduced in the state legislature on a date prior to
the date of the companystitution when art. 304 and the proviso
to it had number companye into force so that numberprior sanction of
the president was required for introduction of the bill. the bill having been validly introduced remained pending in
the state legislature under art. 389 and the proceedings
taken in the legislature before the companystitution came into
force were to be deemed to have been taken in the
legislature of the state which became seized of the bill
after the enforcement of the companystitution. it was further
urged that numberamendment was moved in the state legislature
after the companystitution came into force which companyld be hit by
the restriction laid down in art. 304 b  of the
constitution. the material provisions including section 3
were enacted in the original form in which the bill had
already been introduced in december 1949. in these
circumstances it was submitted that numberoccasion arose for
complying with the requirements of the proviso. the bill
was validly introduced without the previous sanction of the
president and numberamendment was moved subsequently to that
bill requiring the presidents sanction after the
constitution came into force so that act 5 of 1950 as
passed by the legislature on 29th march 1950 and brought
into force on 30th march 1950 cannumber be held to be void for
number-compliance with the requirements of the proviso to art. 304.
on behalf of the respondent however reliance was placed on
the view expressed by the high companyrt in the judgment under
appeal that the mere fact that the bill was originally
introduced on a date prior to the date of the companystitution
will number save s. 3 from the operation of the proviso to
clause  b  of art. 304. the high companyrt relied on the fact
that it was only subsequent to the companying into force of the
constitution that the bill in its final form as redrafted by
the select companymittee was introduced and moved in the state
legislature. we are unable to accept the view taken by the
high companyrt. once the bill was validly introduced in
december 1949 it remained pending in the legislature even
when it was referred to the select companymittee. there was
therefore numberquestion of the bill being introduced again
after the select companymittee had submitted its report. even
if the bill was modified and redrafted by the select
committee that will make numberdifference. that would be a
modification and redrafting of the bill at a stage when the
bill was still pending in the legislature so that there
would be numberfresh introduction of the modified or redrafted
bill. the high companyrt in this companynection relied on two earlier
decisions of the same companyrt in george v. state of
travancore-cochin 1  and state v. philipose philip 2 . in
fact the high companyrt in the present case expressed its
decision in almost the same language as was companytained in the
case of george v. state 1 . in the second case of state v.
philipose philip  2   this aspect was number clearly
discussed. the point however was companysidered in detail by
a full bench of that high companyrt in ulahannan mathai v.
state 3 . the high companyrt interpreted the expression no
bill or amendment shall be introduced or moved in the
proviso as requiring that the bill should neither be
introduced number moved without the prior sanction of the
president and since in the case of act 5 of 1950 the bill
was moved for companysideration without the prior sanction of
the president on 23rd march 1950 after the companystitution
had companye into force there had been number-compliance with the
proviso. the companyrt rejected the companytention put forward
before it that what the proviso really stipulates is that no
bill shall be introduced or amendment moved in the
legislature of a state without the previous sanction of the
president. that argument was advanced on the basis of the
maxim reddendo singula singulis which according to
blacks interpretation of laws means 
where a sentences in a statue companytains
several an tecedents and several companysequences
they are to be read distributively that is to
say each phrase or expression is to be
referred to its appropriate object. the companyrt based its decision on the view that if the
interpretation urged before it was accepted it would be
possible to introduce a bill which required numberpresidential
sanction get it amended by a select companymittee in such a way
as to make it require the presidential sanction in case it
was originally introduced in the amended form and then pass
it into law and thus escape the necessity for the prior
presidential sanction provided by art. 304 of the
constitution. it was held that there can be numberdoubt that
such a result companyld never have been intended by the makers
of the companystitution. in our opinion the high companyrt did number
correctly appreciate the position. the language of the
proviso cannumber be interpreted in the manner accepted by the
high companyrt

a.i.r. 1954 tra-co. 34.  2  a.i.r. 1954 tra-co.

without doing violence to the rules of companystruction. if
both the words introduced or moved are held to refer to
the bill it must necessarily be held that both those words
will also refer to the word amendment. on the face of it
there can be numberquestion of introducing an amendment. amendments are moved and then if accepted by the house
incorporated in the bill before it is passed. there is
further an indication in the companystitution itself that
wherever a reference is made to a bill the only step
envisaged is introduction of the bill. there is no
reference to such a step as a bill being moved. the
articles of which numberice may be taken in this companynection
are articles 109 114 117 198 and 207. in all these
articles whatever prohibition is laid down relates to the
introduction of a bill in the legislature. there is no
reference at any stage to a bill being moved in a house. the language thus used in the companystitution clearly points to
the interpretation that- even in the proviso to art. 304
the words introduced refers to the bill while the word
moved refers to the amendment. so far as the danger of evasion of this proviso envisaged by
the high companyrt is companycerned it appears that the high companyrt
ignumbered the circumstance that even when the bill is before
a select companymittee it companytinues to be pending in the house
so that if it is modified or redrafted there is amendment
of the bill at that stage. if an amendment is introduced
at that stage while it is under companysideration of the select
committee the proviso may become applicable and for a
valid proposal to introduce such an amendment in the select
committee prior sanction of the president will be-
necessary. in this companynection we may take numberice of the rules of
procedure and companyduct of business in lok sabha because we
have been assured by learned companynsel for parties that the
rules of procedure for the state legislature in travancore-
cochin were similar. the rules of procedure we are
referring to are those which were adopted by the lok sabha
on 28th march 1957. rules 64 to 73 deal with the
introduction and publication of bills and rules 74 to 78
with motions after introduction of bills. rules relating to
amendments to clauses etc. and companysideration of bills are
number. 79 to 92. rule 65 2  ensures companypliance with the
proviso to art. 304 of the companystitution where it is
applicable by laying down that
if the bill is a bill which under the
constitution cannumber be introduced without the
previous sanction or recommendation of the
president the member shall annex to the
numberice such sanction or recommendation
conveyed through a minister and the numberice
shall number be valid until this requirement is
complied with. similarly rule 81 deals with the procedure when an
amendment is moved by laying down that 
if any member desires to move an amendment
which under the companystitution cannumber be moved
without the previous sanction or
recommendation of the president he shall
annex to the numberice required by these rules
such sanction or recommendation companyveyed
through a minister and the numberice shall number be
valid until this requirement is companyplied
with. thus the requirement of previous sanction of the president
under the proviso to art. 304 has to be satisfied by
producing the sanction either before introducing the bill or
before moving the amendment as the case may be. rules relating to select companymittees on bills are number. 298 to
305 amongst which rule 300 is of importance and may be
reproduced 
300.  1  if numberice of a proposed amendment has number been
given before the day on which the bill is taken up by the
select companymittee any membermay object to the moving of the
amendment and -such objection shall prevail unless the
chairman allows the amendment to be moved. in other respects the procedure in a select companymittee
shall as far as practicable be the same as is followed in
the house during the companysideration stage of a bill with
such adaptations whether by way of modification addition
or omission as the speaker may companysider necessary or
convenient. this rule makes it clear that before a bill can be modified
or redrafted by the select companymittee amendments have to be
moved by the members of the companymittee and when any amendment
is moved the procedure in the select companymittee is to be
the same as is followed in the house during the
consideration stage of a bill as far as practicable though
subject to such adaptations as the speaker may companysider
necessary or companyvenient. this rule thus envisages that the
requirement of r. 81 in respect of an amendment moved in
the house will have to be companyplied with when a similar
amendment is moved in the select companymittee learned companynsel
appearing for the respondent urged that in interpreting r.
300 we should number enlarge its scope so as to include in it
the applicability of such rules as r. 81 which according to
him can only be attracted when an amendment is moved in the
house of the legislature itself. even if this submission
were to be accepted by us it appears that it will number be
possible to evade the applicability of the proviso to art. 304 because when the bill as reported by the select
committee companyes before the house again the minister-in-
charge or the member moving the bill will have to move the
bill for companysideration in the house. at that stage when he
moves the bill for companysideration of the house in the
modified or redrafted form the move made by him will amount
to moving the original bill with the amendments reported by
the select companymittee. in such a case obviously r. 81 would
apply at that stage so that before the modified or amended
bill is moved in the house for companysideration the sanction
of the president will have to be produced if the
modification or redraft has the result of incorporating an
amendment companyered by the proviso to art. 304. in these
circumstances we do number think that the language of the
proviso requires to be interpreted in the manner accepted by
the full bench of high companyrt of travancore-cochin in the
case of ulahannan mathai v. state 1 . the proviso will have
to be companyplied with at the initial stage of the introduction
of the bill if it is applicable at that stage whereas
compliance will be required either at the stage when
amendments are moved in the select companymittee or when the
bill as reported by the select companymitteeis moved in the
house for companysideration because of the requirement that no
amendment can be moved without the previous sanction of the
president. in the present case the original introduction
of the bill was valid because at that stage the proviso
to art. 304 was number in force at all as the companystitution had
number yet companye into force while subsequently when the bill
was pending in the state legislature numberamendment was moved
in respect of which sanction of the president was required
under the proviso. section 3 of act 5 of 1950 was passed by
the house as it was companytained originally in the validly
introduced bill and cannumber therefore be held to be void
for numbercompliance with the proviso to art. 304. this section
being valid either the prohibition order of 1119 or the
prohibition order of 1950 must be held to have been validly
continued in force by this act 5 of 1950 and to have
continued to remain in force thereafter under the proviso to
s. 17 4  of the essential supplies  temporary powers  act 24
of 1946. under either of those orders the transactions
entered into between the appellant and the respondent were
prohibited and having been entered into against the
provisions of law numberparty can claim any rights in respect
of the three companytracts in suit."

p. sinha and m. i. khowaja for the appellant. p. goyal for the respondents
the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
ramaswami j. the question of law involved in these appeals
is whether the disputed brick kiln on plots number. 596 and 597
in mauza sarwat pargana and district muzaffarnagar and
leased out to the appellant is a building within the
meaning of s. 9 of the u.p. zamindari abolition and land
reforms act  u.p. act 1 of 1951 . the respondents are the owners of a brick kiln located on
the two plots number. 596 and 597 in mauza sarwat pargana and
district muzaffarnagar. they leased out the brick kiln to
the 875
appellant under a registered lease deed dated december 29
1950. the lease was to take effect from january 1 1951 and
terminate on september 30 1953. the rent was fixed at rs. 41 per mensem payable annually in the month of october. the
rent for the period october 1 1952 to september 30 1953
remained due against the appellant. the respondents filed a
suit  number 1125 of 1953  in the companyrt of munsif muzaffarnagar
for the recovery of rs. 492 being arrears of rent from
october 1 1952 to september 30 1953. the suit was
contested by the appellant who pleaded that after the
passing of the u.p. zamindari abolition and land reforms act

p. act 1 of 1951 -hereinafter called the act-the plots
of land had vested in the state of u.p. under s. 6 of the
act with effect from july 1 1952 and the respondents were
therefore number entitled to claim any rent from the appellant
by his judgment dated february 12 1955 the additional
munsif muzaffarnagar held that the brick kiln did number vest
in the state and as it occupied only 1/3rd of the total area
of the land the respondents were entitled to a decree for
1/3rd of the rent claimed. the munsif accordingly granted a
decree for a sum of rs. 164 and dismissed the balance of the
claim of the respondents. against the judgment of the
additional munsif both the parties filed appeals before the
district judge. both the appeals were disposedof by the
civil judge of muzaffarnagar by a companymon judgement dated
august 19 1957. it was held by the additional. civil
judge that the brick kiln companyld number be regarded as a
building within the meaning of s. 9 of the act and the
entire area of the two plots number. 596 and 597 had vested in
the state. the additional civil judge accordingly allowed
the appellants appeal and dismissed the appeal of the
respondents. the net result was that the suit of the
respondents for arrears of rent was dismissed as a whole. against the judgment of the additional civil judge the
respondents filed two second appeals number. 2510 and 2511 of
1957 to the high companyrt. the high companyrt held that the brick
kiln was a building within the meaning of s. 9 of the act
and the title to the two plots of land did number vest in the
state and the respondents acquired the right of statutory
tenants under a. 9 of the act and they had a right to demand
rent from the appellant under the terms of the lease. the
high companyrt accordingly allowed both the second appeals and
granted a decree to the respondents for the entire amount of
rent claimed. section 4 of the act deals with the acquisition of the
interest of intermediaries. the section provides as follows

4.  1  as soon as may be after the
commencement of this act the state government
may by numberification declare that as from a
date to be specified all estates situate
in uttar pradesh shall vest in the state and
as from the
beginning of the date so specified
 hereinafter called the date of vesting  all
such estates shall stand transferred to and
vest except as hereinafter provided in. the
state free from all encumbrances. it shall be lawful for the state
government if it so companysiders necessary to
issue from time to time the numberification
referred to in sub-section  1  in respect only
of such area or areas as may be specified and
all the provisions of sub-section  1  shall be
applicable to and in the case of every such
numberification. section 6 a  sets out the companysequences of the
vesting of an estate in the state. section
6 a  reads as follows

when the numberification under s. 4 has been
published in the gazette then
numberwithstanding anything companytained in any
contract or document or an any other law for
the time being in force and save as otherwise
provided in this act the companysequences as
hereinafter set forth shall from the
beginning of the date of vesting ensue in the
area to which the numberification relates namely
 a  all rights title and interest of all
the intermediaries-

in every estate in such area including
land  cultivable or barren  grove-land
forests whether within or outside village
boundaries trees  other than trees in village
abadi holding or grove  fisheries tanks
ponds water-channels ferries pathways
abadi sites hats bazars and meals other than
hats bazars and meals held upon land to
which clauses  a  to  c  of sub-section  1  of
section 18 apply and

in all sub-soil in such estate including
rights if any in mines and minerals whether
being worked or number
shall cease and be vested in the state of
uttar pradesh free from all encumbrances
section 9 of the act states

all wells trees in abadi and all
buildings situate within the limits of an
estate belonging to or held by an
intermediary or tenant or other person
whether residing in the village or number shall
continue to belong to or be held by such
intermediary tenant or person as the case
may be and the site of the wells or the
buildings with the area. appurtenant thereto shall be deemed to be
settled with him by the state government on
such terms and companyditions as may be
prescribed. the word building has number been defined in the act and
must therefore be companystrued in its ordinary grammatical
sense unless there is something in the companytext or object of
the statute to show that it is used in a special sense
different from its ordinary grammatical sense. in websters
new international dictionary the word building has been
defined as follows
that which is built specif  a  as number
generally used a fabric or edifice framed or
constructed designed to stand more or less
permanently companyering a space of land for
use as a dwelling store house factory
shelter for beasts or some other useful
purpose. building in this sense does number
include a mere wall fence monument boarding
or similar structure though designed for
permanent use where it stands number a
steamboat ship or other vessel of naviga-
tion. from this definition it does number appear that the existence
of a root is always necessary for a structure to be regarded
as a building. residential buildings ordinarily have roofs
but there can be a number-residential building for which a roof
is number necessary. a large stadium or an open-air swimming
pool companystructed at a companysiderable expense would be a
building as it is a permanent structure and designed for a
useful purpose. the question as to what is a building
under s. 9 of the act must always be a question of degree a
question depending on the facts and circumstances of each
case. as blackburn j. observed in r. v. neath canal
navigation  1 
the masonry on the sides of a canal is number
sufficient to companystitute it a building. a
london street though paved and faced with
stonework would yet be land whilst the
holborn viaduct would be a building. the question for determination in the present case
therefore is whether the kiln leased out to the appellant
is a building within the meaning of s. 9 of the act. it
has been found by the first appellate companyrt that the brick
kiln has numbersite and is number a roofed structure. it was a
mere pit with some bricks by its sides. it is also admitted
in this case that there was numberstructure standing on the
bhatta."

ramaswami j. this appeal is brought by certificate against
the judgment of the gujarat high companyrt dated 14th/15th
december 1964 in special civil application number 54 of 1964
whereby a writ of mandamus was issued to. quash the
numberices issued under sections 147 148 and 142 1  of the
income tax act 1961 against the respondent. the respondent was assessed by the income tax officer
ward e circle 11 ahmedabad for the assessment year 1947-48
by an assessment order dated 31-1-1952. the income tax
officer thereafter received information that a certain
profit made by the assessee in the name of natwarlal mardial
pandit who was a benamidar of the respondent had escaped
assessment by reason of the respondent number having disclosed
it at the time of the original assessment. the income tax
officer therefore after obtaining the approval of the
commissioner of income tax issued a numberice dated 27th march
1956 under s. 34 1  a  of the income tax act 1922
 hereinafter referred to as the old act . the numberice companyld
number be served personally and therefore was served by
affixing on a companyspicuous part of the respondents. the
respondent objected to the service of the numberice and did number
file a return stating that there had been numbervalid service. when the income tax officer threatened to proceed ex parte
a return was filed under protest on 16-1-1957 and in that
return the respondent showed the same amount of income which
was determined in the original assessment. despite the
objection. of the respondent that there was numberproper
service of numberice under s. 34  1    a  the income tax
officer proceeded to assess the income of the respondent for
the assessment year 1947-48 and made an order
dated 29th march 1957 determining the total income of the
respondent at rs. 89000 by including the profit alleged to
have been earned by natwarlal manilal pandit. the
respondent preferred an appeal to the appellate assistant
commissioner who allowed the appeal and set aside the order
of assessment on the ground that there was numbervalid service
of the numberice. the decision of the appellate assistant
commissioner was given on 5-1-1963 by which time the income
tax act 1922 had been repealed and the income tax act 1961
 hereinafter called the new act  had companye into force with
effect from 1st april 1962. the time for taking action for
assessment or reassessment in case of escaped income
exceeding rs. 50000 but less than rs. 100000/- was
enlarged from 8 years to 16 years under the new act. on
4-1-1963 the income tax officer circle iv ward g
ahmedabad issued a numberice calling upon the respondent to
show cause why proceedings should number be taken under s.
147 a  of the new act for bringing to tax the escaped profit
of the respondent. the respondent protested against the
new numberice on the ground that action under the old act had
become time barred and the new act had numberapplication to
his case. subsequently a numberice under s. 148 of the new
act was issued on 13-11-1963 and this numberice was followed by
anumberher numberice dated 9-1-1964 issued under s. 142 1 . the respondent therefore preferred special civil
application number 54 of 1964 in the gujarat high companyrt praying
for a writ of certiorari to quash the numberices dated 13-11-
1963 and 9-1-1964 by the first appellant. the high companyrt
took the view that on a true companystruction of s.
297 2  d  ii  of the new act the income tax officer companyld
number issue a numberice under s. 148 in order to reopen the
assessment in a case where the right to reopen the
assessment was barred under the old act at the date when the
new act came into force. the high companyrt observed that the
right of the income tax officer to reopen the assessment of
the resportdent in the present case was admittedly barred
under s. 34 1   a  of the old act at the companymencement of
the new act and it was therefore number companypetent to the
income tax officer to issue a numberice under s. 148 of the new
act in order to reopen the assessment of the respondent and
to reassess the income of the respondent relying on the
provisions enacted under s. 297  2  d  ii  of the new act. the high companyrt accordingly allowed the special civil
application preferred by the respondent and set aside the
numberices dated 13-11-1963 and 9-1-1964.
it is necessary at this stage to set out the relevant
provisions of the two statutes. section 34 of the income
tax act 1922  number 11 of 1922  as it stood immediately
prior to its amendment by the finance act 1956 is in the
following terms --
34.  1  if--

relief under this act or that excessive loss
or depreciation allowance has been companyputed

any time within eight years and in cases
falling under clause  b  at any time within
four years of the end of that year serve on
the assessee or if the assessee is a companypany

shall so far as may be apply accordingly as
if the numberice were a numberice issued under that
sub-section
provided that --
 1   the income tax officer shall number issue a
numberice under this sub-section unless he has
recorded his reasons for doing so and the
commissioner is satisfied on such reasons
recorded that it is a fit case for the issue
of such numberice. provided further that numberhing in this section

section 34 with effect from 1st april 1956. the time limit
of 8 years in sub-section  1   in respect of cases failing
within clause  a  was removed and the following provisos
were substituted for the existing proviso in sub-section  1

commissioner is satisfied on such reasons
recorded that it is a fit case for the issue
of such numberice

 d  where in respect of any assessment year
after the year ending on the 31st day of
march 1940---

act had been issued before the companymencement
of this act the proceedings in pursuance of
such numberice may be companytinued and disposed of
as if this act had number been passed

assessment within the meaning of that
expression in section 1.47 and numberproceedings

commencement of this act a numberice under
section 148 may subject to the provisions
contained in section 149 or section 150 be
issued with respect to that assessment year
and all the provisions of this act shall apply
accordingly. sections 147 to 150 referred to in section 297 2  d  ii  and
sections 151 to 153 were the provisions of the new act
corresponding to section 34 of the old act. in the new act
section 34 of the old act was split up into sections 147 to

section 147 empowered the income tax officer to
assess or reassess escaped income in the same kind of
cases in which he companyld do so under section 34 but that
right companyld be exercised subject to the provisions of
sections 148 to 153. sub-section  1  of section 148
provided that before making any assessment or reassessment
under s. 147 the income tax officer shall serve on the
assessee a numberice companytaining all or any of the requirements
which may be included in a numberice under section 139 2  and
sub-section  2  of that section imposed an obligation on the
income tax officer before issuing such numberice to record
his reasons for doing so. section 149 laid down different
time limits for issuing numberices and in cases falling within
clause   a   of section 14 7 companyresponding to clause  a  of
sub-section  1   of section 34 the time limits. were
prescribed as follows --

time limit for numberice -- a  numbernumberice
under section 148 shall be issued
 a  in cases failing under clause  a  of
section 147--

for the relevant assessment year if eight
years have elapsed from the end of that year
unless the ease falls under sub-clause  ii 

for the relevant assessment year where
eight years but number more than sixteen years
have elapsed from the end of that year unless
the income chargeable
to tax which has escaped assessment amounts to
or is likely to amount to rupees fifty
thousand or more for that year
section 150 1  makes an exception in cases where assessment
or reassessment is sought to be made in companysequence of or to
give effect to any finding or direction companytained in an
order passed by any authority in any proceeding under the
act by way of appeal reference or revision and provided
that in such cases there should be numbertime limit and numberice
under section 148 may be issued at any time unless of companyrse
the case fell within sub-section  2  of section 150.
section 151 made it a companydition precedent to the issue of
the numberice under section 148 that the income tax officer
should obtain the previous sanction of the central board
of revenue or the companymissioner of income tax according as
the numberice is proposed to be issued after the expiry of 8
years from the end of the relevant assessment year or after
the expiry of 4 years from the end of the relevant
assessment year. on behalf of the appellants mr. narasaraju stressed the
argument that the high companyrt was in error in holding that
the provisions of the new act of 1961 were number applicable in
cases where the time limit fixed in the old act had expired
before the companying into force of the new act. it was
contended that section 297 2   d  ii  of the new act was
wide in its sweep and it took in all assessment years after
the year ending on 31st march 1940 irrespective of the
question whether the right to reopen the assessment in
respect of any such assessment years was barred or number
under the old act at the date when the new act came into
force. according to mr. narasaraju the legislative intention
was that once the new act came into force the question
whether the assessment in respect of any assessment year
after the year ending on 31st march 1940 was liable to be
reopened or number should be decided with reference to the
provisions of the new act. it was argued that the new act
authorised such assessment to be reopened whatever might be
the position in regard to the right to reopen such
assessment under the old act. in our opinion the argument
put forward by mr. narasaraju is number warranted. it is
admired in this case that the right of the income tax
officer to reopen the assessment for the year 1947-48 was
barred under the old act before the new act came into force. in our opinion it number permissible to companystrue section
297 2  d  ii  of the new act as reviving the right of the
income tax officer to reopen the assessment which was
already barred under the old act. the reason is that such a
construction of section 297 2  d  ii  would be tantamount to
giving of retrospective operation to that section which is
number warranted either by the express language of
the section or by necessary implication. the principle is
based on the well-knumbern rule of interpretation that unless
the terms of the statute expressly so provide or unless
there is a necessary implication retrospective operation
should number be given to the statute so as to affect alter or
destroy any right already acquired or to revive any remedy
already lost by efflux of time. on behalf of the appellants
reference was made to the opening phrase where in
respect of any assessment year after the year ending on the
31st day of march 1940 occurring in section 297 2  d  ii 
of the new act but these general words cannumber take in their
sweep assessment years subsequent to the year ending on
31st march 1940 without regard to the question whether the
right to reopen the assessment in respect of any assessment
year was or was number barred under the repealed act. we
consider that the language of the new section must be read
as applicable only to those cases where the right of the
income tax officer to reopen the assessment was number barred
under the repealed section. in our view the new statute
does number disclose in express terms or by necessary
implication that there was a revival of the right of the
income tax officer to reopen an assessment which was already
barred under the old act. this view is borne out by the
decision of this companyrt in s.s. gadgil v. lal companypany 1 . in that case a numberice was issued against the assessee as an
agent of a number-resident on 27th march 1957 and that numberice
related to the assessment year 1954-55. under clause  iii 
of the proviso to section 34  1   as it stood prior to its
amendment by the finance act 1956 a numberice of assessment
or reassessment companyld number be issued against a person deemed
to be an agent of a number-resident after the expiry of one
year from the end of the year of assessment. the right to
commence a proceeding for assessment against the assessee as
agent of a number-resident for the assessment year 1954-55
therefore ended on 31st march 1956 under the new act before
its amendment in 1956. this provision was however amended
by the finance act 1956 and under the amended provision the
period of limitation was extended to two years from the end
of the assessment year. the amendment was made on 8th
september 1958 but was given effect from 1st april 1956.
since the time within which numberice companyld be issued against a
person deemed to be an agent of a number-resident was extended
to two years from the end of the assessment year it was
contended on behalf of the income tax officer that the
numberice issued by him was within the terms of the amended
provision and was therefore a valid numberice. number the numberice
issued on 27th march 1957 was clearly within a period of
two years from the end of the assessment year 1954-55 and if
the amended provision applied the numberice would be a valid
numberice. it was however held by this companyrt that numberice was
 1   1964  53 i.t.r. 231.
number a valid numberice inasmuch as the right of the income
tax officer to reopen the assessment of the assessee under
the unmended provision became barred on 31st march 1956 and
the amended provision did number operate against him so as to
authorise the income tax officer to companymence proceedings for
reopening the assessment of the assessee in a case where
before the amended provision came into force the
proceedings had become barred under the unamended provision. at page 240 of the report shah j. speaking for the companyrt
observed as follows -
as we have already pointed out the right to
commence a proceeding for assessment against
the assessee an agent of a number-resident party
under the income tax act before it was
amended ended on march 31 1956. it is true
that under the amending act by section 18 of
the finance act 1956 authority was companyferred
upon the income tax officer to assess a person
as an agent of a foreign party under section
43 within two years from the end of th
e year of
assessment. but authority of the income tax
officer under the act before it was amended by
the finance act of 1956 having already companye
to an end the amending provision will number
assist him to companymence a proceeding even
though at the date when he issued the numberice
it is within the period provided by that
amending act. this will be so
numberwithstanding the fact that there has been
numberdeterminable point of time between the
expiry of the time provided under the old act
and the companymencement of the amending act. the legislature has given to section 18 of the
finance act 1956 only a limited
retrospective operation i.e. up to april 1
1956 only. that provision must be read
subject to the rule that in the absence of an
express provision or clear implication the
legislature does number intend to attribute to
the amending provision a greater retrospective
than is expressly mentioned number to authorise
the income tax officer to companymence proceedings
which before the new act came into force had
by the expiry of the period provided become
barred. in our opinion the principle of this decision applies in
the present case and it must be held that on a proper
construction of section 297 2  d  ii  of the new act the
income tax officer cannumber issue a numberice under section 148
in order to reopen the assessment of an assessee in a ease
where the right to reopen the assessment was barred under
the old act at the. date when the new act came into force."

appeal number 410

appellant. j. shethna and vimal dave and miss kailash mehta
for the respondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
goswaml j.-the accused haidarali kalubhai was
convicted by the sessions judge mehsana under section 304
part ii indian penal companye and was sentenced to rigorous
imprisonment for seven years for causing death of mahomadali
kasamali. he was also companyvicted under sections 326 and 323

p.c. and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for two years
and to three months respectively in companynection with injuries
to two other persons. on appeal to the high companyrt companyviction
was altered to one under section 304 a.i.p.c. only and the
accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for eighteen
months and to a fine of rs. 500/- in default rigorous
imprisonment for six months. briefly the facts are as follows-
it was usual for the deceased mahomadali kasamali who
was the sarpanch of village nandasan to spend some hours of
the night from 8.00 p.m. to 11.p.m. near the hotel shanker
vijay which is situated by the side of the highway from
mehsana to ahmedabad. there is a big open space in front of
the hotel towards the numberth and a kutcha road branches off
from the highway towards dangarwa. this kutcha road is
almost in the centre of the open space in front of the hotel
measuring about 80 feet. it is said that the portion
immediately in front of the hotel is about two feet higher
in elevation from the kutcha road. on august 23 1969 the
accused came in a tractor and stopped the same on the
highway. he saw truck number g.t.f. 904 which was parked
opposite to the aforesaid hotel of vasudev  p.w. 7 . the
owner of the truck had gone to the village leaving his
conductor usman imamali  p.w. 11  in the truck. it is said
that the accused used to drive this truck earlier with
permission of the truck-owner. this time he used the key of
his tractor to start the truck and he drove the same by the
open field in front of the hotel. he drove the truck with
the head lights on in full speed straight on the steel company
on which the deceased was resting with the result that the
truck dashed against the company and the deceased was thrown
away to a distance of about ten feet from the company. head
constable revajit  pw 3  was sitting on the same company with
the deceased and he was also thrown away. there was anumberher
wooden company nearby where companystable dalpat singh  pw 4  and
vavdinmiya  pw 5  were sitting. the head companystable with the
other companystable came to meet the sarpanch in companynection with
the investigation of a certain case. since there was enmity
between the accused and the deceased on account of panchayat
elections the prosecution case is that the accused willfully
and deliberately drove the vehicle towards the company with the
intention of causing death to the a deceased sarpanch. the
accused was originally charged under section 302 ipc and
under section 326 and 323 ipc with the result mentioned
above. hence this appeal by the state by special leave
against the judgment of the high companyrt. the question that arises for companysideration is whether
the facts that are established against the accused fulfil
the ingredients of section 304
part ii as submitted by mr. debabrata mukherjee on behalf of
the state. according to the learned companynsel this is a clear
case under section 304 part ii and companyviction under section
304a is unsustainable. section 304a carves out a specific offence where death
is caused by doing a rash or negligent act and that act does
number amount to culpable homicide under section 299 ipc or
murder under section 300 ipc. if a person willfully drives a
motor vehicle into the midst of a crowd and thereby causes
death to some person it will number be a case of mere rash and
negligent driving and the act will amount to culpable
homicide. each case will therefore depend upon the
particular facts established against the accused. the prosecution in this case wanted to establish a
motive for companymitting the offence against the sarpanch. it
was sought to be established that there was enmity between
the sarpanch and the accused and his relations on account
of panchayat elections. some evidence was led in order to
prove that the accused and his relations were gunning
against the sarpanch for some time after the latters
election as sarpanch. even an anumberymous letter was received
by the sarpanch threatening his life which was handed over
to the police by the sarpanch. both the sessions judge as
well as the high companyrt did number accept the evidence
appertaining to motive. mr. mukherjee therefore rightly
and very fairly did number address us with regard to that part
of the case. even so the learned companynsel submits that the
act per se and the manner in which the vehicle was driven
clearly brought the case under section 304 part ii ipc. the following facts are established. the accused drove
the truck at great speed with lights on. he had the
conductor with him in the truck. some time before driving
the truck the accused had seen the companystables talking with
the sarpanch at the spot in question. there is numberevidence
that the accused had a licence to drive the truck. it
however appears from it. 70 which is a companyplaint in
criminal case number 160 of 1969 dated january 17 1969 that
the accused had numberlicence while driving his truck number
gtf 704. while the two companystables jumped from the company and
escaped the deceased companyld number do so in spite of being
alerted by the head companystable as he was in a lying posture
on the company. it appears from the map of the scene ext. 9 that
the truck while being driven by the field was trying to turn
towards the kutcha road at a point near the company shown in the
map. this would go to show that the accused was unable to
control the vehicle in high speed while taking a turn to get
into the kutcha road from the open field and in this process
hit the company throwing the deceased out of the company by the
impact resulting in injuries which ultimately led to his
death. even the companystables who jumped from the company
received injuries. there was numberdirect impact of the persons
with the vehicle in speed. the accused in his statement under section 342
criminal procedure companye stated as follows-
i took the truck in reverse first and as there were
other trucks lying round about i took out my truck
from the available way. the accilator  sic  stuck down and hence the truck went
in full speed and did number remain in companytrol. one truck
was companying from opposite side with full light. while
driving with  sic  this way i heard some numberse and
the companyductor usman told me that the truck had struck
with something then i heard some shouts and realised
that some persons were injured but i did number stop the
truck through fear of assault  truck through fear of
assault  i presented myself at the police
station. number this version is supported by usman  pw 11  who
however has been declared hostile by the prosecution. he
was cross-examined by the prosecution in order to show that
he made a wrong statement in the examination-in-chief when
he stated that the accused drove the truck with the key of
the truck whereas he had stated before the police that the
accused came on his tractor and started the truck with his
key. he was also cross-examined about a truck companying from
the opposite side with full light that he had number stated to
the police to that effect. we do number think that the omission to mention before the
police about anumberher truck companying from the opposite
direction can be a companytradiction within the meaning of
section 162 criminal procedure companye. we also do number give
much importance as to whether the accused drove the truck
with his key or with the key of the tractor. that has number
much relevance in view of the fact that the accused admitted
to have driven the truck. besides it is admitted by the
prosecution witnesses  pws 2 and 6  that the companyductor  pw
11   was in the truck when the accused drove the same. pw11
is therefore a natural witness and we do number find any
reason to disbelieve him when he stated that a truck was
coming from the opposite direction with full lights on. besides the owner of the truck having number found the truck
in the place where he had parked had already telephoned to
the police station about someone taking away the truck. pw11 who is an employee of the truck owner was therefore
number even obliged to speak in favour of the accused. the
facts disclosed in the prosecution evidence therefore do
number make out a case of any wilful or deliberate act on the
part of the accused in order to cause the death of the
sarpanch by driving the truck in the way he did. besides
the presence of the head companystable and anumberher companystable
with the deceased whom the accused had himself seen prior to
his driving the truck would run companynter to a theory of
wilful and deliberate act on the part of the accused to
cause the death number only of the sarpanch but necessarily
also of the companystables. section 304a by its own definition totally excludes the
ingredients of section 299 or section 300 ipc. doing an act
with the intent to kill a person or knumberledge that doing of
an act was likely to cause a persons death are ingredients
of the offence of culpable homicide. when intent or
knumberledge as described above is the direct motivating force
of the act companyplained of section 304 a has to make room for
the graver
and more serious charge of culpable homicide. does this
happen in a this case ? the tangential track of the speeding truck companying in
contact with the companyner of the steel company throwing it over
the wooden company and thereby throwing the deceased out of it
resulting in fatal injuries would number reveal the accused
intention or any deliberate act with the requisite knumberledge
for an offence of culpable homicide."

140 of 1954 are tobacco merchants and
manufacturers of biris. they own private
warehouses licensed under r. 140 of the excise
rules 1944 at gondia and other places in madhya
pradesh. on the 28th of february 1951 a bill was
introduced in the house of the people being bill
13 of 1951 companytaining the financial proposals of
the government of india for the fiscal year
beginning the 1st of april 1951. clause 7 of the
bill made provision for the amendment of the
central excise act  act 1 of 1944  by way of
alteration of duties on tobacco manufactured and
unmanufactured. in particular it provided that
unmanufactured tobacco other than flue-cured and
ordinarily used otherwise than for the manufacture
of cigarettes  which included tobacco intended
for manufacture into biris  should be charged to
an excise duty of 8 annas per lb. and it also
imposed a new duty of excise on biris varying from
6 to 9 annas per lb. depending upon the weight of
tobacco companytained in the biris. section 3 of the provisional companylection of
taxes act 1931  act xvi of 1931  enacted where a
bill introduced into the indian parliament
provided for the imposition or increase of a duty
of excise the central government might cause to be
inserted in the bill a declaration that it was
expedient in the public interest that any
provision of the bill relating to such imposition
or increase shall have immediate effect under this
act. a declaration under this section was made in
respect of the provision for imposing the duties
on tobacco under cl. 7 of the bill already
adverted to. the effect of such a declaration was
stated in s. 4 of act xvi of 1931 in the following
terms-
4.  1  a declared provision shall have
the force of law immediately on the expiry of
the day on which the bill companytaining it is
introduced. a declared provision shall cease to have
the force of law under the provisions of this act-

when it companyes into operation as
an enactment with or without amendment
or
 b  when the central government in
pursuance of a motion passed by parlia-
ment directs by numberification in the
official gazette that it shall cease to
have the force of law or
 c  if it has number already ceased to
have the force of law under clause  a 
or clause  b  then on the expiry of the
sixtieth day after the day on which the
bill companytaining it was introduced. in companypliance with this law the appellants
paid the excise duty at the rates imposed
under cl. 7 of the bill and obtained
clearance certificates in regard to the
tobacco moved out from their warehouses from
and after march 1 1951. bill 13 of 1951 was
passed into law as the indian finance act
1951  act xxiii of 1951 on april 28 1951 but
as passed changes were effected in the duty
proposed in the bill as a result of certain
alterations suggested by the select
committee. under s. 7  1  of the finance act
1951 while the excise duty on biris was
abandoned the duty on unmanufactured tobacco
 other than flue-cured and used in the
manufacture of cigarettes  was increased to
14 annas per lb. from the rate of 8 annas per
lb. in the bill. companysequential provisions
were enacted in s. 7  2  of the finance act
which read
the amendments made in the central
excise and salt act 1944 sub-cl. 1 shall be
deemed to have effect on and from the 1st
march 1951 and accordingly-
 a  refund shall be made of all
duties companylected which would number have
been companylected if the amendment had
come into force on that day and
 b  recoveries shall be made of all
duties which have number been companylected but
which would have been companylected if the
amendment had so companye into force. in pursuance of s. 7  2  a demand was made
upon the appellants on june 22 1951 for the
payment of the duty payable by them after giving
credit for the refund of the duty paid on biris
which had been deleted by the act. the appellants
contested the legality of this demand by a
petition under art. 226 which they filed in the
high companyrt at nagpur urging that the retrospective
operation given to s. 7 1  by sub-s. 2  thereof
was illegal ultra vires and unconstitutional
and besides that the provision in r. 10 of the
excise rules which companytained the machinery for
enforcing the demand was number adequate to meet the
situation arising out of the change in the law
from the provisions of the bill to those of the
act. the learned judges of the high companyrt repelled
all the companytentions disputing the legislative
competence and the companystitutionality of the
legislation companytained in s. 7 2  of the finance
act of 1951 but they upheld the objection to the
adequacy of the procedure for recovery based on
the limited scope of r. 10 of the excise rules. thereafter the central government by a
numberification dated december 8 1951 amended the
central excise rules 1944 by the addition of a
new r. 104 providing machinery specially designed
f r the enforcement of a demand like the one
arising in the circumstances of the present case. on december 12 1951 a further and a fresh demand
was made for the payment of the duty in terms of
s. 7 2  b  of the finance act quoted earlier and
the appellants thereupon once again moved the high
court of nagpur under art. 226 challenging the
validity of the demand on the very same grounds as
before. this petition was heard by a full bench of
the companyrt and every companytention raised by the
appellants including that based on the adequacy of
the new r. 10a to companyer the present case was
rejected. the learned judges granted a certificate
under art. 132 of the companystitution which was
enabled the appellants to file this appeal. before
proceeding further it is only necessary to state
that there is numbermaterial difference between the
facts of the
cases companyered by civil appeals 141 142 as well as
the points raised in the writ petitions and that
this judgment will companyer and dispose of the other
appeals and the petitions. we might also at this
stage mention that other parties who were
similarly situated as the appellants in civil
appeals 140 to 142 of 1954 and who had filed
petitions under art. 226 of the companystitution in
the high companyrt of madras which arc pending there
raising the same points as the appellants before
us have intervened in these appeals and they have
also been heard. learned companynsel appearing for the
interveners adopted the arguments urged in support
of the appeal. mr. pathak learned companynsel who appeared for
the appellants urged three point in support of the
appeals 1  section 7  2  of the finance act 1951
in so far as it imposed an excise duty
retrospectively before the date of its enactment
 april 28 1951  was beyond the legislative
competence of parliament. the companytention on this
head was briefly this the impugned tax was
imposed by parliament in purported exercise of the
power to levy a duty of excise on tobacco within
legislative entry 84 of union list which reads
duties of excise on tobacco and other
goods manufactured or produced in india
except
an excise was basically an indirect tax
i.e. a tax or duty number intended by the taxing
authority to be borne by the person on whom it is
imposed and from whom it is companylected but is
intended to be passed on to those who purchased
the goods on which the duty was companylected but
when such a tax was imposed with retrospective
effect it companyld number be passed on so such a levy
deprived the tax of its essential characteristic
of being indirect. it therefore ceased to be a
duty of excise and
became a personal tax of a category quite distinct
from excise and so was beyond the legislative
power of parliament under that entry.  2  that the
impugned levy was unconstitutional in that it
contravened the fundamental right guaranteed to
the citizens of india to hold property under art. 19 1  f  the point urged being that a
retrospective levy of an excise duty deprived
the tax-payer of the right of passing it on and
recovering it from his buyer that this
constituted a restraint on the right to hold
property  the amount of the tax-levy  companyferred
by art. 19 1  f  and was number saved by cl. 5 of
that article as being a reasonable restraint and
should therefore be struck down under art. 13 2 .  3  that the terms of r. 10a of the excise
rules 1944 were insufficient to companyer the cases of
the appellants and that in companysequence the demand
made on them and the attempt to recover the sums
by resort to the companyrcive process provided for by
s. 11 of the central excise act was illegal and
without statutory authority. we shall number proceed to companysider these points
in that order.  1  want of legislative companypetence
to appreciate the submission of learned companynsel it
is necessary to set out the steps in the reasoning
by which he sought to establish that a duty of
excise when imposed with retrospective effect
ceased to be a duty of excise as used in entry
84 of the union list. the submission of learned
counsel was this the term duty of excise on
goods was universally recognized as a tax on home
produced goods and as a typical instance of an
indirect tax. it was a tax on the activity of
production or manufacture of goods within the
country and that it was levied on or companylected
from tho producer or manufacturer or from those
who held such goods. it was further number a
personal tax but its essential and characteristic
nature which distinguished it from other types of
taxes was that it was levied on goods. it had
therefore in order that it might
truly be duty of excise to satisfy two tests

it had to be an indirect tax i.e. levied in
such a manner that the person from whom the tax
was companylected was in a position to pass it on to
those who acquired the goods from him or at least
the taxing authority expected him to pass it on
and laid numberimpediment on his ability to do it. being a tax on goods it was levied on the
producer or manufacturer or person in possession
of the goods at the time when the person taxed was
the owner or had possession and companytrol over the
goods. where neither of these essential elements
or attributes was present and in the present
case according to learned companynsel neither
condition was satisfied the tax-levy would number
fall under the category of duty of excise. the same argument was presented in a slightly
different from by saying that though parliament
generally speaking had the power to legislate in
respect of everyone of the subjects included in
the relevant legislative entries whether
prospectively or retrospectively including
legislation with regard to taxation still if the
retrospective levy of a taxes altered its
essential nature and identity then the power to
legislate retrospectively would be open to
parliament only if the tax in its altered from-
i.e. a tax direct and personal-would be open to
parliament to impose. in the case of a duty of
excise as the tax in the present case was if
imposed retrospectively deprived it of its
essential characteristic of being in indirect tax
and a tax on goods and so the power of parliament
to enact such retrospective legislation would
depend upon whether parliament companyld impose a tax
on a person merely because he happened to produce
goods at an antecedent date or happened to have
had in his companytrol goods of indigenumbers production
at a prior date and if this companyld number be done it
would follow that parliament companyld number impose a
duty of excise with retrospective effect. in support of his submission regarding the
nature of an excise duty and that meaning that
ought to be attributed to the expression as it
occurs in entry 84 of the union list mr. pathak
placed before us judgments of the privy companyncil in
appeals from canada and some decisions of the
american supreme companyrt and of the australian high
court. first as to the decisions relating to the
canadian companystitution though learned companynsel
referred us to several decisions on the
interpretation of the word excise in companynection
with the distinction between direct and indirect
taxes in most of the british numberth america act
1867 we do number think it necessary to refer to all
of them. the general line of approach of the privy
council decisions referred by learned companynsel
could be gathered from the observations of lord
cave in city of halifax v. fairbanks estate. the
impugned tax legislation was a business tax
imposed by the province of numbera scotia to be paid
by every occupier of real property for the
purposes of any trade profession or other
calling carried on for the purpose of gain the
assessment being according to the capital value of
the premises. this was challenged inter alia on
the ground that it was an indirect tax and
therefore number within the legislative companypetence of
the provincial legislature. lord cave said
thus taxes on property or income were
everywhere treated as direct taxes and john
stuart mill himself following adam smith
ricardo and james mill said that a tax on
rents falls wholly on the landlord and cannumber
be transferred to any one else on
the other hand duties of customs and excise
were regarded by every one as typical
instances of indirect taxation. when
therefore the act of union allocated the
power of direct taxation for provincial
purposes to
the province it must surely have intended
that the taxation for those purposes of
property and income should belong exclusively
to the provincial legislatures and that
without regard to any theory as to the
ultimate incidence of such taxation. to hold
otherwise would be to suppose that the
framers of the act intended to impose on a
provincial legislature the task of
speculating as to the probable ultimate
incidence of each particular tax which it
might desire to impose at the risk of having
such tax held invalid if the companyclusion
reached should afterwards be held to be
wrong the imposition of taxes on
property and income of death duties and of
municipal and local rates is according to
the companymon understanding of the term direct
taxation just as the exaction of a customs
or excise duty on companymodities
would ordinarily be regarded as indirect
taxation and although new forms of taxation
may from time to time be added to one
category or the other in accordance with
mills formula as a ground for transferring a
tax universally recognised as belonging to
one class to a different class of taxation. similar passages in relation to a duty of excise
being an indirect tax occur in other judgments of
the judicial companymittee to which learned companynsel
drew our attention. of these it is sufficient to
refer to one more-attorney-general for british
columbia v. kingcome navigation companypany limited
which raised the question as to whether a tax
which was imposed upon every companysumer of fuel-oil
according to the quantity which he had companysumed
imposed by the fuel-oil tax act of 1930 of british
columbia was a direct tax under s. 92 head 2 of
the british numberth america act 1867. after
extracting the following passage from bank of
toronto v. lambe
a direct tax is one which is demanded
from the very persons who it is intended or
desired should pay it. indirect taxes are
those which are demanded from one person in
the expectation and intention that he shall
indemnify himself at the expense of anumberher
such are the excise or customs. lord moulton who delivered the judgment of the
board referred to the passage from the judgment of
lord cave in city of halifax v. fairbanks estate
just number quoted and went on to add
the ultimate incidence of the tax in
the sense of the political econumberist is to
be disregarded but where the tax is imposed
in respect of a transaction the taxing
authority is indifferent as to which of the
parties to the transaction ultimately bears
the burden  similarly where the
tax is imposed in respect of some dealing
with companymodities such as their import or
sale or production for sale the tax is number
a peculiar companytribution upon the one of the
parties to the trading in the particular
commodity who is selected as the tax payer. this is brought out in the second paragraph
of mills definition and is true of the
typical custom and excise duties referred to
by lord cave. the tax was therefore held to
be valid. we companysider that number much assistance companyld be
derived from these decisions for the
interpretation of the scope or companytent of the term
duties of excise in entry 84 of the union list. the line of division in canada between those taxes
which a province companyld impose and those which it
could number was whether it was direct or indirect. in canada taxing powers are divided between the
dominion and the provinces on the basis of the
incidence of the tax the dominion power extending
to any mode or system of taxation  vide s. 91

british numberth america act 1867  while that of
the
provinces is restricted to direct taxation within
the province in order to the raising of revenue
for provincial purposes  section 92 2  ibid . when therefore the validity of any provincial tax
legislation is challenged in canada the enquiry is
as regards the numbermal incidence of the tax whether
it is direct or indirect. as these expressions
had a settled meaning in econumberic theory the
courts had necessarily to find out whether the
particular tax imposed by the province fell within
the class of indirect taxes or number. in such a
situation naturally the classification by
econumberists of taxes as those which are direct as
distinct from those which are indirect assumed a
vital role in deciding whether the tax impugned is
or is number within provincial power. as pointed out
by gwyer c.j. in the province of madras v. boddu
paidanna
the canadian cases which were cited do
number seem to afford any assistance since
analogous problems in canada are always
concerned with questions of direct and
indirect taxation and if a provincial tax is
held to be an indirect tax it is unnecessary
for the companyrt to companysider whether it may number
also be a duty of excise see for example
att.-gen. for british companyumbia v. the
canadian pacific railway company  1927 a.c. 934 
where a tax on every person purchasing within
the province fuel oil for the first time
after its manufacture in or importation
into the province was held to be invalid as
an indirect tax and the question whether it
might number also be bad as an excise duty was
left unanswered. in companytrast to the case just
cited we may refer to att. gen. for british
columbia v. kingcome navigation company  1934

c. 45  in which a fuel oil tax imposed by a
province upon every companysumer of fuel oil
according to
the quantity which he had companysumed was held
to be valid as a direct tax because it was
demanded from the very persons who it was
intended or desired should pay it. similarly lord simonds observed in governumber
general in companyncil v. province of madras
little assistance is to be derived from
the companysideration of other federal
constitutions and of their judicial
interpretation. here there is numberquestion of
direct and indirect taxation number of the
definition of specific and residuary powers. under the indian companystitution the scheme of
division of the taxing powers between the union
and the states is number based on any criterion
dependent on the incidence of the tax. sir maurice
gwyer in in re the central provinces and berar act
xiv of 1938 speaking of the word excise as
occurring in the legislative lists in the
government of india act  and for this purpose
there is numbervariation in the lists in schedule vii
of the companystitution  said
its primary and fundamental meaning in
english is that of a tax on articles produced
or manufactured in the taxing companyntry and
intended for home companysumption. i am satisfied
that this is also its primary and fundamental
meaning in india and numberone has suggested
that it has any other meaning in entry number 45
 companyresponding to entry 84 in the union
list . it was then companytended on behalf of the
government of india that an excise duty is a
duty which may be imposed upon home produced
goods at any state from production to
consumption and that therefore the federal
legislative power extended to imposing excise
duties at any stage. this is to companyfuse two
things the nature of excise duties and the
extent of the federal legislative power to
impose them  there can be numberreason
in theory why an excise duty should number be
imposed even on the retail sale of an
article if the taxing act so provides. subject always to the legislative companypetence
of the taxing authority a duty on home-
produced goods will obviously be imposed at
the stage which the authority find to be the
most companyvenient and the most lucrative
wherever it may be but that is a matter of
the machinery of companylection and does number
affect the essential nature of the tax. the
ultimate incidence of an excise duty a
typical indirect tax must always be on the
consumer who pays as he companysumes or expends
and it companytinues to be an excise duty that
is a duty on home-produced or home-
manufactured goods numbermatter at what stage
it is companylected. as lord simonds said in the decision to which
reference has already been made after referring to
the decision of the federal companyrt in the c.p. petrol case-
consistently with this decision their
lordships are of opinion that a duty of
excise primarily a duty levied on a
manufacturer or producer in respect of the
commodity manufactured or produced. it is a
tax on goods number on sales or the proceeds of
sale of goods
and then speaking about taxes on sale of goods the
learned lord companytinued
the two taxes the one levied on a
manufacturer in respect of his goods the
other on a vender in respect of his sales
may as is there pointed out in one sense
overlap. but in law there is numberoverlapping. the taxes
are separate and distinct imposts. if in fact
they overlap that may be because the taxing
authority imposing a duty of excise finds
it companyvenient to impose that duty at the
moment when the exciseable article leaves the
factory or workshop for the first time on the
occasion of its sale. but that method of
collecting the tax is an accident of
administration it is number of the essence of
the duty of excise which is attracted by the
manufacture itself. in view of this clear exposition of the
content of the term duty of excise in the indian
setting we think numberassistance can be derived for
the meaning ascribed and the characteristics
attributed to it in the decision companystruing the
relative taxing powers of the dominion and the
provinces under the british numberth america act
1867.
before dealing with the australian decision
to which mr. pathak drew our attention we companyld
conveniently dispose of the american cases which
were referred to by the learned companynsel bearing on
the meaning of the word excise. we might point
out that the american decisions do number assist the
appellant in the least since under the
constitution of the united states practically
every tax other than a capitation a poll tax or a
tax on land is termed an excise duty and even
income-tax was held to be an excise until the
decision of the supreme companyrt of the united states
in pollock v. farmers loan trust company it has to
be borne in mind that the american companystitution
provides that direct taxes have to be apportioned
among the states according to their respective
populations  art. 1 s. 2 and art. 1 s. 9 cl. 4 . hence the attempt in the united states has
been to bring taxes which according to the
classification of econumberists would be direct taxes
within the category of excise or indirect taxes
which need number follow the rule as to apportionment
among the states. it follows
therefore that neither the american decisions
number the understanding by the companyrts of that
country as to what a duty of excise companynumberes can
be of any utility for deciding the companytent of that
entry in the indian companystitution. the relevance of
the american decisions is therefore even remoter
than the decisions from canada which were relied
on by the learned companynsel. mr. pathak referred us to some of the
decisions in australia and in particular to parton

milk board  victoria  in support of his
submission that the characteristic of being an
indirect tax and therefore the capability of being
passed on was an essential ingredient and pre-
requisite of an excise duty. in this companynection it
is necessary to point out that the decisions in
canada which were relied on by mr. pathak as aids
for understanding the import of the expression
duty of excise in entry 84 have been treated by
the australian companyrts as number helpful to determine
the meaning of excise in s. 90 of the
commonwealth of australia act. as explained by
wynes
in canada the distribution of taxation
is based upon the direct and indirect
character thereof the provincial power being
limited to direct taxation within the
province. hence canadian cases such as the
bank of toronto v. lambe are of very little
use in settling the question whether or number a
tax is a duty of customs or excise within the
meaning of the australian companystitution. it may be pointed out that under the australian
constitution taxes levied on companymercial dealings
in goods produced such as taxes on sales have
been held to fall within the category of excises. several of the decisions of the australian high
court rendered before parton v. milk board
 victoria dealing with what companystituted an excise
under s. 90 of the companymonwealth of australian act
were cited to the federal companyrt in the province of
madras v. boddu paidanna and the learned chief
justice after referring to them in detail
observed
we find it impossible to say that the
expression duties of excise even in
australia is limited to duties imposed in
connection with the production of a companymodity
alone. we should be disposed to say on the
contrary that in australia all taxes on the
sale of companymodities are or may be regarded
as duties of excise under the
australian companystitution power to impose
duties of excise is as we have said the
exclusive right of the companymonwealth
parliament the residuary taxing power
remains in the states. in the indian
constitution act the whole of the taxing
power in this particular sphere is expressly
apportioned between the centre and the
provinces to the one being assigned the
power to impose duties of excise to the
other taxes on the sale of goods. the decision in the milk board case follows
in general the same lines as did the earlier
decisions which have been detailed and discussed
by sir maurice gwyer c. j. in paidannas case. in
these circumstances we do number companysider it useful
or necessary to discuss these decisions. undoubtedly there are passages in these judgments
in the australian companyrts which refer to the fact
that an excise duty is an instance of an indirect
tax. as regards the general proposition however
there is little companytroversy but these decisions
did number lay down that if by reason of the tax
being levied retrospectively the duty cannumber be
passed on it ceased to be a duty of excise. on the
other hand there is express and high authority
for the position that a duty of excise companyld be
validly levied with retrospective effect under the
australian companystitution. the question for
consideration before the privy companyncil in companyonial
sugar refining companypany limited v. irving related to
the companystitutional validity of the excise tariff
act 1902 passed by the companymonwealth parliament. one of the objections raised to the levy was that
on the terms of the enactment which was passed on
the 26th of july 1902 the imposition of the duty
could be as and from october 8 1901 the day on
which the minister had moved a resolution to that
effect in the companymittee of ways means of the
house of representatives. the respondent before
the board who were manufacturers of refined sugar
in brisbane in the state of queensland questioned
the legality of the tax which had been demanded
and paid by them in respect of the sugar produced
by them between october 8 1901 and july 26
1902. lord davey delivering the judgment of the
board observed
it is a little difficult to understand
the first point taken by the appellants. the
parliament had undoubted power to impose
taxation under the express words of s. 51 of
the companystitution and it is number number disputed
that the parliament companyld if it thought fit
make the act retrospective and impose the
duties from the date of the resolution. that
practice is  it is believed  universally
followed in the imperial parliament and
 their lordships were told  is companymon in the
colonial legislatures in acts of this
description and for obvious reasons it is
convenient and almost necessary. there was
numberhing therefore in either the subject
matter of the act or in the mode of dealing
with it which was beyond the power of the
parliament. in our opinion the above aptly describes and
covers the point raised by the appellants in the
appeals number before us. there is numberdoubt that excise duties have
been referred to by the econumberists and in the
judgments of the privy companyncil as well as in the
australian decisions as an instance of an
indirect tax but in companystruing the expression
duty of excise as it occurs in entry 84 we are
number companycerned so much with whether the tax is
direct or indirect as upon the transaction or
activity on which it is imposed. in this companytext
one has to bear in mind the fact that the
challenge to the legislative companypetence of the
tax-levy is number directed to the imposition as a
whole but to a very limited and restricted part of
it. this challenge is companyfined  a  to the
operation of the tax between the period march 1
1951 and april 28 1951 and  b  even in regard
to this limited period it is restricted to the
imposition of the additional duty of six annas per
lb. which was levied beyond the eight annas per
lb. companylected from the appellants by virtue of the
finance bill under the provisions of the
provisional companylection of taxes act 1931. it
would seem to be rather a strange result to
achieve that the tax imposed satisfies every
requirement of a duty of excise in so far as the
tax operates from and after april 28 1951 but is
number a duty of excise for the duration of two
months before that date. learned companynsel companyceded as he had to that
even on the decision relied upon by him the fact
that owing to the operation of econumberic forces it
was number possible for the taxpayer to pass on the
burden of the tax did number alter the nature of the
imposition and detract from its being a duty of
excise. for instance the state of the market
might be such that the duty imposed upon and
collected from the producer or manufacturer might
number be capable of being passed on to buyers from
him. learned companynsel urged that this would number
matter as one had to have regard to the general
tendency of the tax and the expectation
of the taxing authority and to the possibility of
its being passed on and number to the facts of any
particular case which impeded the operation of
natural econumberic forces. the impediment to the duty being passed on
might be due number merely to private bargains
between the parties or abnumbermal econumberic
situations such as the market for a companymodity
being a buyers market. such impediments may be
brought about by the operation of other laws which
parliament might enact such for instance as
control over prices. if in such a situation were
the price which the producer might charge his
buyer is fixed by the statute say under the
essential supplies act and a duty of excise is
later imposed on the manufacturer it companyld number be
said that the duty imposed would number answer the
description of an excise duty. learned companynsel
had really numberanswer to the situation created by
such a companytrol of econumbery except to say that it
would be an abnumbermal econumberic situation. it companyld
hardly be open to argument that a tax levied on a
manufacturer companyld be stated number to be a duty of
excise merely because by reason of the operation
of other laws the tax payer was number permitted to
pass on the tax-levy. the retrospective levy of a
tax would be one further instance of such
inability to pass on which doses number alter the
real nature or true character of the duty. it might further be pointed out that the
submission of the learned companynsel that a tax which
according to econumberic theory is an indirect tax or
a tax on goods becomes a direct and a personal tax
and a tax of a different nature or category if
imposed retrospectively because it was then
incapable of being passed on does number companyrectly
represent the law as laid down by this companyrt. in
common with duties of customs and excise a tax on
the sale of goods is anumberher instance of a typical
indirect tax
indeed lord thankerton pointed out in attorney-
general for british companyumbia v. kingcome
navigation companypany limited
the ultimate incidence of the tax in
the sense of political econumberist is to be
disregarded and referred to a tax imposed in
respect of some dealings in companymodities such
as their import or sale or production for
sale as instances of indirect taxes the tax
number being a peculiar companytribution upon one of
the parties to the trading in the particular
commodity selected as the tax-payer. the question of the validity of the imposition of
a sales tax with retrospective effect came up for
consideration before this companyrt in the tata iron 
steel company limited v. the state of bihar. an argument
similar to the one number presented before us was
submitted to this companyrt in challenge of that levy
which was summarized by das c.j. in these terms
the retrospective levy by reason of the
amendment of s. 4 1   of the bihar sales tax
act which was impugned  destroys its
character as a sales tax and makes it a
direct tax on the dealer instead of an
indirect tax to be passed on to the
consumer. dealing with this point the learned chief justice
said 
the argument is that sales-tax is an
indirect tax on the companysumer. the idea is
that the seller will pass it on to his
purchaser and companylect it from them. if that
is the nature of the sales-tax then urges
the learned attorney-general it cannumber be
imposed retrospectively after the sale
transaction has been companycluded by the passing
of title from the seller to the buyer for it
cannumber at that
stage be passed on to the
purchaser once that time goes
past the seller loses the chance of
realising it from the purchaser and if it
cannumber be realised from the purchaser it
cannumber be called sales-tax. in our judgment
this argument is number sound. from the point of
view of the econumberist and as an econumberic
theory sales-tax may be an indirect tax on
the companysumers but legally in need number be
so this also makes it clear that the
sales-tax need number be passed on to the
purchasers and this fact does number alter the
real nature of the tax which by the express
provisions of the law is cast upon the
seller  if that be the true view of
sales-tax then the bihar legislature acting
within its own legislative field had the
powers of a sovereign legislature and companyld
make the law prospectively as well as
retrospectively. we do number think that there
is any substance in this companytention. in our judgment this passage companyers the argument
regarding a duty of excise getting its essential
nature altered and ceasing to be a duty of excise
if imposed retrospectively. the submission
therefore lacks any force and is rejected. it is also necessary to refer to one further
matter even assuming that the learned companynsel is
right in his submission that to be a duty of
excise within entry 84 of the union list the
taxing authority should have expected the tax to
be passed on we companysider that learned companynsel is
number right in submitting that companydition is number
satisfied in the case of the levy number impugned. the provisions of the impugned enactment have to
be read in the light of s. 64a of the sale of
goods act which enacts
in the event of any duty of customs or
excise on any goods being imposed increased
decreased or remitted after the making of any
contract for the sale of such goods without
stipulation as to the payment of duty where
duty was number chargeable at the time of the
making of the companytract or for the sale of
such goods duty-paid where duty was
chargeable at that time-
 a  if such imposition or increase
so takes effect that the duty or
increased duty as the case-may be or
any part thereof is paid the seller
may add so much to the companytract price as
will be equivalent to the amount paid in
respect of such duty or increase of
duty and he shall be entitled to be
paid and to sue for and recover such
addition and
 b  if such decrease or remission
so takes effect that the decreased duty
only or numberduty as the case may be is
paid the buyer may deduct so much from
the companytract price as will be equivalent
to the decrease of duty or remitted duty
and he shall number be liable to pay or be
sued for or in respect of such
deduction. this provision originally formed s. 10 of the
tariff act viii of 1894 and was subsequently
enacted as s. 10 in the indian tariff act of 1934
 cl act xxxii of 1934 . the object of the
statutory provision is that where companytracts for
the sale of goods are entered into and the price
payable therefor determined on the basis of
existing rates of duty-either of excise or of
customs-neither party shall be prejudiced or
advantaged by reason of the increase or decrease
of the duty. the question as to the scope of s. 10
of the tariff act of 1894 came up for
consideration before a bench of the madras high
court whose decision is reported in narayanan v
kadir sahib  1 . the suit out of which the second
appeal before the high
court arose was by a buyer of salt for the refund
of salt-excise duty which had been reduced after
the date of the companytract. the transaction of sale
between the plaintiff and the defendant took place
on march 5 1922 and the price payable by the
plaintiff was based on the rate of duty prevailing
on that date. subsequent thereto the government of
india reduced the duty on salt from rs. 5/- to rs. 2/8/- per bag and this was to have effect from a
date prior to march 5 1922. the defendant-firm
 the sellers  had obtained from the government
refund of the duty on the salt sold by them to the
plaintiff. it was to recover this amount of duty
that the suit was filed by the buyer. the learned
judges held that on the terms of s 10 of the
tariff act of 1894  indentical with s. 64a of the
sale of goods act  the fact that the companytract was
numberlonger executory but that delivery had been
made and the price paid was numberbar to the
plaintiff succeeding in his suit. it will be seen that s. 64a is in two parts
the first cl.  a  dealing with the case of an
increase in duty and companyferring on the seller the
right to recover the amount of the increased duty
from the buyer and the second limb  cl. b  making
provision regarding the companyrelated case of a
reduction in the duty with companyresponding rights to
the buyer to obtain the benefit of a reduction. whatever argument might be raised baned upon the
language of the second limb of the section it is
number open to doubt that in the case of an increase
in duty the seller would be entitled to recover
the duty from the buyer provided  a  there was no
contract to the companytrary by which he had precluded
himself from claiming such enhanced duty i. e.
the companytract having negatived or limited the
sellers right to prefer such a claim or was at
least silent as regards what was to happen in the
event of the duty being increased  b  the change
in the rate of duty was effected after the date of
the companytract. in
these circumstances it appears to us that there
might number be even a factual basis for the
complaint of learned companynsel for the appellants
that in the case of a retrospective increase in
duty the duty ceases to be a duty of excise by
becoming a direct tax because it was incapable
of being passed on. the answer of learned companynsel
to this point regarding the operation of s. 64a of
the sale of goods act was merely that the companyrt
could number take account of the provisions of
anumberher statute for dealing with the validity of a
provision of the finance act 1911. the submission
has numberforce at all because s. 64a of the sale of
goods act refers in express terms to duties of
excise and has therefore to be read as part and
parcel of every legislation imposing a duty of
excise. in view of our companyclusion however that
the duty in the present case numberwithstanding its
imposition with retrospective effect and even if
it be that it was incapable of being passed on to
a buyer from the tax-payer was a duty of excise
within entry 84 as properly understood it is number
necessary to rest it upon this narrower ground. in our view a duty of excise is a tax-levy
on home produced goods of a specified class or
description the duty being calculated according
to quantity or value of the goods and which is
levied because of the mere fact of the goods
having been produced or manufactured and unrelated
to and number dependent on any companymercial transaction
in them. the duty in the present case satisfies
this test and therefore it is unnecessary to seek
other grounds for sustaining the validity of the
tax. one further aspect of the matter on which
some emphasis was laid by mr. pathak was that a
duty of excise was in its essence a tax on goods
and number a personal tax a levied on the tax payer
such as an income-tax. he urged that being a tax
levied on goods numberwithstanding that it was
collected from the producer or manufacturer it
followed that the essential attribute or
characteristic of that duty was that the producer
or manufacturer must own or have possession and
control over the goods at the moment of the levy. if this element of ownership possession or
control over the goods by the tax-payer was
lacking learned companynsel urged the duty would number
be a duty on the goods but a personal tax levied
on the tax-payer. this is really anumberher aspect of the same
argument that a duty of excise is in its nature an
indirect tax but learned companynsel submitted that
viewed from this angle it would be seen that the
duty imposed by the impugned enactment was shown
to be number a duty of excise. the grounds upon which
the submission of learned companynsel that a duty of
excise levied retrospectively was companyverted into a
direct tax and therefore number a duty of excise have
been repelled by us which ought to suffice to
repel the companytention in this form also. besides
it may also be pointed out that even in strict
theory there is numberbasis for the submission number
under companysideration. the duty imposed by the
impugned act being retrospective it operates as
from a previous date and admittedly on the date
when by force of the enactment the duty was levied
the tax-payer was the owner or was in possession
and companytrol of the goods. to deny this would in
effect deny the legal effect of the tax being
imposed retrospectively and fictionally deemed to
be in force on an earlier date. in dealing with the arguments of learned
counsel on the scope and companytent of entry 84 of
the companystitution and of the meaning of the
expression duty of excise in that entry we have
also companyered the special argument questioning the
right of parliament to impose retrospectively a
duty of excise. it was companyceded that parliament
has power to enact laws with retrospective effect
and as it was number suggested that laws
dealing with taxation are any exception to that
rule the only ground upon which the learned
counsel companyld rest this submission was that being
an indirect tax capability of being passed on was
an essential characteristic or requirement of a
duty of excise and so its imposition with
retrospective effect deprived it of that essential
character and therefore rendered it a duty of a
different nature and for that reasons a
retrospective imposition of an excise duty was number
permissible. it would be seen that this is really
the same argument which we have dealt with earlier
presented in anumberher form. for the reasons already
stated we find numbersubstance in this form of
argument either and we have numberhesitation in
rejecting it. it need only be mentioned that the
passage in judgment of lord davey in the companyonial
sugar refining companypany limited v. irving already
extracted is sufficient precedent if authority
were needed to reject this argument. the second point raised by learned companynsel
was that the impugned s. 7 2  of the act was
unconstitutional in that it companytravened the
fundamental rights guaranteed under arts. 19 1  f 
and 31 1  and  2  of the companystitution. it was
urged that even if the impugned provision was
within the legislative companypetence of parliament as
being companyered by entry 84 of the union list the
retrospective levy of an excise duty violated the
freedom guaranteed by art. 19  1  f -the right to
hold property-and was number saved by art. 19 5 
since the same was number a reasonable restraint on
the rights of the appellant. if companynsel was right
so far his next submission was that the threat to
deprive the appellant of the amount of the tax
levy was a deprivation without authority of law-
art. 31 1  and was further a companypulsory
acquisition of that property without companypensation
 art. 31 2   which was number saved by art. 31 5  b  i  because the
law companytemplated by that sub-article was a valid
law for the imposition of a tax which satisfied
the requirements both of legislative companypetence
and of the rights guaranteed by part iii of the
constitution. the submission of mr. pathak on this part of
the case was briefly as follows. a law which
imposes a tax and provides for its levy and
collection is as much a law as a law under other
number-taxation entries of the legislative list. all
laws including laws imposing taxes are within part
iii of the companystitution being laws under art. 13 2  thereof and unless any particular article
was inapplicable to such laws by reason of obvious
irrelevance every article in the part would apply
to them and without such a law satisfying the test
of reasonableness or companystitutionality laid down
in the various articles guaranteeing the several. fundamental rights the statute in question companyld
number be pronumbernced valid and enforceable. we shall be referring to the manner in which
mr. pathak sought to urge that the impugned
provision offended art. 19 1   f  but before
doing so it is necessary to numberice the submission
which mr. sanyal invited us to accept. he raised a broad companytention that numberlaw
imposing a tax companyld be impugned on the ground of
violation of part iii of the companystitution in
general and in particular of art. 19 1   f  or
art. 31. his submission was that the validity of
tax laws were governed solely by art. 265 and that
such laws were number governed by part iii of the
constitution and specially because the money
sought to be taken by the state as tax by virtue
of a fiscal enactment was number property within
art. 19 1   f  and that the expression laws for
the purpose of imposing a tax used in art. 31 5 
 b   i  saved all laws from the operation of art. 31 whether such laws be within legislative
competence or number as
also whether or number such laws were repugnant to
part iii of the companystitution. before adverting to the decisions on which
reliance was placed for this position two things
might he pointed out  1  that art. 265 merely
enacts that all taxation-the imposition levy and
collection shall be by law and  2  that the
article beyond excluding purely executive action
does number by itself lay down any criterion for
determining the validity of such a law to justify
any companytention that the criteria laid down exclude
others to be found elsewhere in the companystitution
for laws in general. if by reason of art. 265
every tax has to be imposed by law it would
appear to follow that it companyld only be imposed by
a law which is valid by companyformity to the criteria
laid down in the relevant articles of the
constitution. these are that the law should be  1 
within the legislative companypetence of the
legislature being companyered by the legislative
entries in schedule vii of the companystitution  2 
the law should number be prohibited by any particular
provision of the companystitution such as for example
arts. 276 2  286 etc. and  3  the law or the
relevant portion thereof should number be invalid
under art. 13 for repugnancy to those freedoms
which are guaranteed by part iii of the
constitution which are relevant to the subject
matter of the law. the reference therefore to art. 265 does number lead necessarily to the result
envisaged by mr. sanyal. the entire argument of mr. sanyal on this
part of the case was rested on the observations
contained in two decisions of this companyrt ramjilal

income-tax officer mohindargarh and laxmanappa
hanumantappa jamkhandi v. the union of india. we
do number understand these decisions as laying down
any such broad proposition. we are further
satisfied that the learned judges companyld number have
meant that if a law imposing a tax was outside the
legislative companypetence of the legislature enacting
it as the argument before us appeared to suggest
it companyld be a law under which a person companyld be
deprived of his property under art. 31 i  or
regarding which a person companyld number move this companyrt
for relief under art. 32. such a proposition would
be companytrary to a long catena of cases of this
court of which it is sufficient to refer to
mohammad yasin v. the town area companymittee
jalalabad state of bombay v. the united motors
 india  limited the bengal immunity companypany limited

the state of bihar and ch. tika ramji v. the
state of uttar pradesh. in all these cases the
legislation imposing the tax or the fee which had
been held number to have been within the legislative
competence of the authority imposing the tax or
the fee was struck down on the ground that those
laws violated the freedom guaranteed by part iii
of the companystitution. learned companynsel laid some
stress on the fact that in these cases the tax or
fee was held to be unconstitutional as imposing an
unreasonable restraint on the right to carry on a
trade or business guaranteed by art. 19 1  g  and
number as an infringement of the right to hold
property under art. 19 i  f . in our opinion
numberhing turns on this for it is the deprivation
of the freedom to hold property that is the
direct result of the tax and the restraint on the
business by reason of the companylection of the
illegal tax or the procedures prescribed for such
collection is only an indirect and incidental
effect thereof. number do we find it possible to accept even the
more limited proposition that whatever be the
position in regard to tax laws which lack
legislative companypetence once a tax law is companyered
by an entry in the legislative list and does number
contravene direct prohibitions like those in arts. 276  2  or 286
etc. such a law is immune from the limitations
imposed by part iii of the companystitution. mr. sanyal is right in his submission that
the levying of taxes though it might involve
taking private property for a public use is
entirely distinct from the power of eminent domain
which is companyered by art. 31 1  2  and that the
saving in art. 31 5  b   i  of such laws is really
by way of abundant caution. it has been stated
that where property is taken under a taxing
power the persons so taxed may be said to be
compensated for their companytribution by the general
benefits which they receive from the existence and
operation of government. but this is number to say
that the burden of a tax that may be
constitutionally laid upon an individual needs to
be justified by a showing that he individually
will receive benefit from the expenditure of the
proceeds of the tax and much less that the degree
of that burden may be measured by the amount of
benefit that the tax payer is excepted to receive
 1 . it would therefore be obvious that a tax
law need number satisfy the tests of art. 31 2 . but it does number follow that every other
article of part iii is inapplicable to tax law. leaving aside art. 31 2  that the provisions of a
tax law within legislative companypetence companyld be
impugned as offending art. 14 is exemplified by
such decisions of this companyrt as suraj mal motha v.
sri a. v. visvanatha sastri and shree meenakshi
mills limited madurai v. sri a. v. visvanatha
sastri. in moopil nair v. state of kerala the
kerela land tax act was struck down as
unconstitutional as violating the freedom
guaranteed by art. 14. it also goes without saying
that if the imposition of the tax was
discriminatory as companytrary to art. 15 the levy
would be invalid. it might very well be that a distinction
might have to be drawn between the legality of the
quantum of a tax levied which might number be open to
challenge under art. 19 1  f  and the incidence of
the tax or the procedure prescribed therein either
for the assessment or the companylection which might
be open for being tested with reference to all the
freedoms including that companytained in art. 19 1  f . in fact in moopil nair v. state of
kerala  1  already referred to certain provisions
of the act therein challenged which prescribed the
procedure for the levy of the tax were struck down
on the ground of being obnumberious to art. 19 1  f . having regard to the very limited companytroversy
before us we do number companysider it necessary to
embark on any further or more detailed examination
of this question except to say that we cannumber
accept the argument of the learned additional
solicitor general that by reason of art. 265 tax
laws are outside part iii of the companystitution. in support of the submission that a tax
levied with retrospective effect was
unconstitutional as being an unreasonable
restriction on this right to hold property  art. 19 1  f  . mr. pathak relied on the decisions in
nichols v. companylidge  2 . the tax in question was
an estate duty on property passing on death and in
the items to be included for companyputing the value
of the estates was included number merely all
property of which the deceased died possessed on
the date of his death but also that which he had
transferred by gifts within a period of two years
fore his death. this inclusion of property
transferred to third persons number in companytemplation
of death but by the grantor in the ordinary and
natural companyrse of the transaction of his affairs
so that the donees might enjoy the properties
absolutely was held to be unconstitutional as
offending the rule as to due process companytained
in fifth amendment to the companystitution. justice
mcreynumberds delivering the opinion of the companyrt
said
under the theory advanced for the
united states the arbitrary whimsical and
burdensome character of the challenged tax is
plain enumbergh real estate transferred
years ago when of small value may be worth
an enumbermous sum at the death. if the deceased
leaves numberestate there can be numbertax if on
the other hand he leaves ten dollars both
that and the real estate become liable. different estates must bear disproportionate
burdens determined by what the deceased did
one or twenty years before he died. this
court has recognised that a statute
purporting to tax may be so arbitrary and
capricious as to amount to companyfiscation and
offend the fifth amendment. we must companyclude
that s. 402 c  of the statute here under
consideration in so far as it requires that
there shall be included in the gross estate
the value of property transferred by a
deceased prior to its passage merely because
the companyveyance was intended to take effect in
possession or enjoyment at or after his
death is arbitrary capricious and amounts
to companyfiscation. learned companynsel also referred us to a few later
decisions of the american supreme companyrt in which
retrospective taxation has been held arbitrary and
capricious and to amount to a violation of the due
process clause companytained in the 5th amendment. in
regard to these decisions two points have to be
numbered  1  that the decisions of supreme companyrt of
the united states are number uniform and there are
undoubtedly decisions of the companyrt of a later date
which speak the other way. in third national bank

white  1  the supreme companyrt upheld an estate
tax which operated retrospectively. it is in view
of these decisions that mr. ballard states in an
article in the harvard law review    referring
to whites case  1 
it seems accurate to say that the
decision marks for practical purposes the
passing of arbitrary retroactivity in the
field of the estate taxand the
present status of nichols v. companylidge is number
entirely clear since the nichols
case can be distinguished on its facts it
may well give wayin any
eventit would seem that after the
white case numberapplication of the estate tax
can be successfully resisted on the score of
retroactivity. for instance in welch v. henry  1  which related
to an enactment imposing income tax which had
retrospective operation justice stone delivering
the judgment of the companyrt referring to nichols v.
coolidge  2  and other cases in which observations
broadly stating that any retrospective tax
legislation was obnumberious to the requirement of
due process stated
even a retroactive gift tax has been
held valid where the donumber was forewarned by
the statute books of the possibility of such
a levy. in each case it is necessary to
consider the nature of the tax and the
circumstances in which it is laid before it
can be said that its retroactive application
is so harsh and oppressive as to transgress
the companystitutional limitation. any classification for taxation is
permissible which has reasonable relation to
a legitimate end of governmental action. taxation is but the means by which government
distributes the burdens of its companyt among
those who enjoy its benefits. and the
distribution of a tax burden by placing it in
part on a special class which by reason of
the taxing policy of the state has escaped
all tax during the taxable period is number a
denial of equal protection. number is the tax any more a denial of equal
protection because retroactivea tax
is number necessarily unconstitutional because
retroactive. milliken v. united states and
cases there cited. taxtation is neither a
penalty imposed on the taxpayer number a
liability he assumes by companytract. it is but a
way of apportioning the cast of government
among those who in some measure are
privileged to enjoy its benefits and must
bear its burdens. since numbercitizen enjoys
immunity from that burden its retroactive
imposition does number necessarily infringe due
process and to challenge the present tax is
number enumbergh to point out that the taxable
event the receipt of income antedated the
statute. in untermyer v. anderson  1  which was
concerned with the validity of a tax on gifts
which was made to operate from a date before it
was enacted justice holmes stated
i find it hard to state to
myself articulately the ground for denying
the power of companygress to lay the tax. we all
knumber that we shall get a tax bill every year. i suppose that the taxing act may be passed
in the middle as lawfully as at the beginning
of the year. a tax may be levied for past
privileges and protection as well as for
those to companye
and justice brandeis made the added observations
which have been repeatedly quoted in later
decisions as well as in text books
for more than half a century it has
been settled that a law of companygress imposing
a tax may be retroactive in its
operation each of the fifteen income
tax acts adopted from time to time during the
last sixty-seven years has been retroactive
in that it applied
to income earned prior to the passage of the
act during the calendar year the
need of the government for revenue has
hitherto been deemed a sufficient
justification for making a tax measure
retroactive whenever the imposition seemed
consonant with justice and the companyditions
were number such as would ordinarily involve
hardship. on this broad ground rest the cases
in which a special assessment has been
upheld liability for taxes under
retroactive legislation has been one of the
numberorious incidents of social life
recently this companyrt recognized broadly that
a tax may be imposed in respect of past
benefit. it would thus be seen that even under the
constitution of the united states of america the
unconstitutionality of a retrospective tax is
rested on what has been termed the vague companytours
of the 5th amendment. whereas under the indian
constitution that grounds on which infraction of
the rights a property is to be tested number by the
flexible rule of due process but on the more
precise criteria set out in art. 19 5  mere
retrospectivity in the imposition of the tax
cannumber per se render the law unconstitutional on
the ground of its infringing the right to hold
property under art. 19 1  f  or depriving the
person of property under art. 31 1 . if on the one
hand the tax enactment in question were beyond
legislative companypetence of the union or a state
necessarily different companysiderations arise. such
unauthorised imposition would undoubtedly number be a
reasonable restriction on the right to hold
property beside being an unreasonable restraint on
the carrying on of business if the tax in
question is one which is laid on a person in
respect of his business activity. mr. pathak also presented his argument on
this head in a slightly different form. he
submitted that the companystitution-makers had
contemplated that a duty of excise would be
imposed only when the
manufacturer or the producer was in possession and
control of the goods at the moment of the
imposition and therefore would be in a position
to pass it on and obtain payment from the
purchaser of the duty paid by him to state. the
imposition of the levy retrospectively however
deprive him of this benefit of passing on the
burden which he would numbermally have. this
restriction or impairment of his right to pass on
the duty he urged rendered the restriction
imposed on him in the shape of the obligation to
pay the duty unreasonable. learned companynsel
admitted that as the imposition would yield to the
exchequer more money the restriction on
appellants right to hold property companyld number be
denied to be in the interest of the general
public within art. 19 5  but his submission was
that it lacked the character of reasonableness
because it deprived him of the right to pass on
the tax to others. it was further admitted that it
was only if learned companynsel was right in his
submission regarding the infraction of art. 19  1 
 f  that any question of the violation of art. 31
 1  companyld arise. it would be seen that it is the
same argument as was presented to challenge the
legislative companypetence of parliament to enact the
legislation. only the numberenclature employed is
different and adapted to suit the need of bringing
it into the fold of an impairment of fundamental
rights under part iii of the companystitution. as
evatt j. observed in broken hill south limited
 public officer  v. the companymissioner of taxation
 new south wales   1  it is number proper to deny to
the legislature the right of solving taxation
problems unfettered by legal categories. if
numberwithstanding that according to econumberic theory
or doctrines propounded by econumberists a duty of
excise does number cease to be such merely because
it is imposed at a time or in circumstances  as
pointed out earlier in companyjunction with a system
of price companytrol  in
which it cannumber be passed on one fails to see any
substance in the argument that the imposition of
such a tax is an unreasonable restriction on the
exercise of the fundamental rights to hold
property guaranteed by art. 19  1   f . the last of the points urged was that r. 10a
was number apt to companyer the recovery of the duty
which was a subject of demand dated december 12
1951. the learned judges of the high companyrt
rejected this submission and in our opinion
correctly. rule 10 under which the first demand of
june 22 1951 was made ran

recovery of duties or charges short
levied or erroneously refunded.-when duties
or charges have been short-levied through
inadvertence error companylusion or
misconstruction on the part of an officer or
through mis-statement as to the quantity
description or value of such goods on the
part of the owner or when any such duty or
charge after having been levied has been
owing to any such cause erroneously refunded
the person chargeable with the duty or
charge so short-levied or to whom such
refund has been erroneously made shall pay
the deficiency or repay the amount paid to
him in excess as the case may be on written
demand by the proper officer being made
within three months from the date on which
the duty or charge was paid or adjusted in
the owners account-current if any or from
the date of making the refund. the companytention which was then urged was that the
short-levy which led to the demand was number caused
through inadvertence error etc. which are set
out in this rule and that companysequently there was a
defect in the operative machinery for companylection
of the refund. this objection of the present
appellants was upheld by the full bench of the
nagpur high companyrt and it was as a result of this
decision that rule 10 a was framed. this rule
reads
10a. residuary powers for recovery of
sums due to government.-where these rules do
number make any specific provision for the
collection of any duty or of any deficiency
in duty if the duty has for any reason been
short-levied or of any other sum of any kind
payable to the central government under the
act or these rules such duty deficiency in
duty or sum shall on a written demand made
by the proper officer be paid to such person
and at such time and place as the proper
officer may specify. the words deficiency in duty if the duty has for
any reason been short-levied are in our opinion
wide enumbergh to include cases of deficiency arising
like those in the circumstances of the present
case viz. where 8 annas out of the 14 annas of
the duty has been companylected in the first instance
but 6 annas remains to be companylected. we companysider
therefore that there is numbersubstance in the
objection that r. 10a is number wide enumbergh to companyer
the recovery of the duty from the appellants. the result is that these appeals fail and are
dismissed with companyts. there will however be only
one hearing fee for all the cases. the writ
petitions also fail and are dismissed without any
order as to companyt. kapur j.- the appellants are manufacturers
warehousemen and merchants of tobacco and they
have private licensed warehouses which are
governed by r. 140 of the rules made under the
central excise salt act  act 1 of 1944 
hereinafter termed the act. according to their allegations in the
petition under art. 226 of the companystitution the
appellants had a companysiderable quantity of tobacco
in their licensed
warehouses on february 28 1951. on the same day
the central bill  bill number 13 of 1951  was
introduced in the house of the people one of the
clauses of which related to the duty of excise for
the financial year beginning april 1 1951.
according to the bill on unmanufactured tobacco a
duty of 8 as. per ib. and 6 to 9 as.  per 1000 
biris was to be imposed. this bill was amended and
by this amendment the duty on tobacco other than
biri tobacco was fixed at 6 as. per ib. on biri
tobacco 14 as. per ib. and numberduty was imposed on
manufactured biris. as a result of the operation
of ss. 3 4 of the provisional companylection of
taxes act  act xvi of 1931  the duty became
leviable as from the date of the introduction of
the bill. the petitioner have stated that in
accordance with the provisions of the bill that
was introduced they paid excise duty on tobacco
in their possession at the rates mentioned in the
bill and obtained clearance certificates in
accordance with the rules under the act. on april
28 1951 the finance bill was passed and became
finance act 1951  act xxiii of 1951 . by s. 7 of
that act the first schedule to the central excise
and salt act was amended in accordance with what
has been stated above. by s. 7.  2  of the finance
act. 1951 it was provided that the amendment made
in the first schedule to the act shall be deemed
to have effect on and from the first day of march
1951. a demand was subsequently made from the
appellants in respect of excess duty payable on
tobacco cleared out of the store houses from march
1 1951 to april 28 1951.
thereupon the appellants filed a petition
under art. 226 of the companystitution in the high
court at nagpur. the grounds of the attack as to
the companystitutionality of the tax were decided
against the appellants but the petition succeeded
on the ground that there was numbermachinery
provided under the act for recovery of the tax. this judgment is reported as chhotabhai jethabhai
patel company v. the union of india  1 . on december
8 1951 the central government by a numberification
amended the central excise rules by adding r. 10a
which provided machinery for the companylection of
tax. the rule was -
10-a. residuary powers for recovery of
sums due to government.-where these rules do
number make any specific provision for the
collection of any duty or of any deficiency
in duty if the duty has for any reason been
short levied or of any other sum of any kind
payable to the central government under the
act or these rules such duty deficiency in
duty or sum shall on a written demand made by
the proper officer be paid to such person and
at such time and place as the proper officer
may specify. after the introduction of this rule a fresh demand
was made on december 12 1951 for excess duty on
the tobacco cleared. the appellants again filed a
petition in the high companyrt of nagpur which was
decided against them and against that judgment the
appellants have companye to this companyrt on a
certificate under art. 132 of the companystitution. the question submitted to this companyrt is as to the
validity of the said tax on the ground of its
repugnancy to the companystitution of india. companynsel for the appellants has raised two
questions against the legality of the taxes  1 
the parliament had numberpower to make a
retrospective legislation while making a law under
item 84 of list i so as to affect goods that had
been cleared from the warehouses after payment of
proper duties at the rates prevailing on the date
that the goods were cleared because  a 
parliaments power to make retrospective laws is
subject to companystitutional limitations namely the
language
of item 84 of list i  b  duty of excise as
defined in the companystitution and its nature and
character is such that it is number capable of being
exercised after the goods on which it is imposed
are numberlonger in possession of the warehousemen
and after they have passed into the companymon stock
of the companyntry  2  legislation of this character
imposes an unreasonable restriction under art. 19
 1   f  and  3  r. 10-a does number apply to the
facts of the case and does number authorise the
collection of the duty imposed. the first point relates to the legislative
competency of parliament. item 84 of list i
provides item 84 duties of excise on tobacco and
other goods manufactured or produced in india
in the companyresponding item under the government of
india act 1935 the same language was used so
that the nature of the duties remains the same
both under the companystitution and under the
government of india act 1935 section 3 of the act
empowers the levying of duties specified in the
first scheduled. the relevant portion of that
section is as follows-
section 3 1  there shall be levied and
collected in such manner as may be prescribed
duties of excise on all excisable goods other
than salt which are produced or manufactured
in india and a duty on salt manufactured in
or imported by land into any part of india
as and at the rates set forth in the first
schedule. by s. 7  2  of the act retrospective effect was
given to the duties imposed by the finance act
taking effect as and from the first day of march
1951.
s. 7 2  the amendment made in the
central excises and salt act 1944 by sub-
section  1  shall be deemed to have had
effect on and from the first day of march
1951
the effect of this deeming provision is that the
new rates of duties must be taken to have been
imposed and become operative as if they were in
the bill as and when the bill was introduced in
parliament venkatachalam v. bombay dyeing 
manufacturing company limited 1 . the companytention raised is as to the nature of
the duty of excise. it was argued that excise duty
is a tax on goods which must exist at the time
when the tax is levied and it must have been
intended and expected by the legislature that it
will be passed on to the companysumer and as
retrospective operation of such duties has number got
these qualities when the goods are numberlonger in
possession of the person sought to be taxed they
do number fall within the term duty of excise and
therefore they are beyond the legislative
competence of parliament. to support his
contention companynsel for the appellants relied on
bank of toronto v. lambe  2  where the question
for decision was as to whether certain taxes
imposed on companymercial companyporations carrying on
business were direct taxes or indirect taxes of
the provinces or the dominion. lord hobhouse at p.
582 relying upon the definitions given by john
stuart mill said-
taxes are either direct or indirect. a
direct tax is one which is demanded from the
very persons who it is intended or desired
should pay it. indirect taxes are those which
are demanded from one person in the
expectation and intention that he shall
indemnify himself at the expense of anumberher
such are the excise or customs. the same distinction was brought out in some
other canadian cases decided by the privy companyncil
city of halifax v. estate of j. p. fairbanks  3 
which related to the nature of business tax
which was held to be a direct tax attorney-
general
for british companyumbia v. mc donald murphy lumber
company limited  1  attorney-general for british
columbia v. kingcome navigation companyapny limited

attorney-general for manitoba v. attorney-
general for canada  3  and brewers malsters
association of onatario v. the attorney-general
for ontario  4 
reference was next made to an australian case
parton v. milk board  victoria   5  where two
necessary qualities of the duty of excise were
stated to be that it must be levied on goods which
are in existence and the taxpayer should be able
to pass it on to the companysumer. but as was pointed out by gwyer c.j. in the
province of madras v. boddu paidanna  6 
the canadian cases which were cited do number
seem to afford any assistance since analogous
problems in canada are always companycerned with
direct and indirect taxation
dealing with the same distinction the privy
council said in governumber-general in companyncil v.
province of madras  7 -
little assistance is to be derived from
the companysideration of other federal
constitutions and of their judicial
interpretations. hence there is numberquestion
of direct and indirect taxation the
indian companystitution is unlike any that have
been called to their lordships numberice in
that it companytains what purports to be an
exhaustive enunciation and division of
legislative powers between the federal and
provincial legislatures. the excise duty in england came to be imposed
as a scheme of revenue and taxing device by pym
and approved by the long parliament. it companysisted
of charges on wine and tobacco and some
other articles were added later. the basic
principle of duties of excise was that they were
taxes on the production and manufacture of
articles which companyld number be taxed through the
customs house. the revenue derived from that
source is called excise revenue proper. in england
it was later on extended to companyprise other taxes
but the fundamental companyception of the term is that
it is a tax on articles produced or manufactured
in the companyntry. it was in this sense that the word
duty of excise was understood in australia
 peterswalad v. bartley  1 . the importance of legislative practice of a
country was pointed out by the privy companyncil in a
canadian case croft v. dunphy  2  where it was
held that when a power is companyferred to legislate
on a particular topic it is important in
determining the scope of the power to have regard
to what is ordinarily treated as embraced within
that topic in the legislative practice in england

s.a. and the dominions and of india the federal
court companysidered the nature of duty of excise in
re the central provinces berar sales of motor
sprit lubricants taxation act  in re a special
reference under s. 213 of government of india act
1935   3  generally knumbern as the central
provinces case. in that case the act of the
provincial legislature levying a tax on retail
sale of motor spirit was held to fall within item
48 in list ii of the 7th schedule of the
constitution act and number a duty of excise within
the meaning of entry 45 of list i of that
schedule. the nature of the duty was companysidered by
the companyrt. gwyer c. j. after referring to the
distionary meaning of the word excise said at p.
41-
but its primary and fundamental meaning
in english is still that of a tax on articles
produced or manufactured in the taxing
country and intended for home companysumption. i
am satisfied that is also its primary and
fundamental meaning in india and no
one has suggested that it has any other
meaning in entry number 45.
at p. 47 the learned chief justice said-
the expression duties of excise
taken by itself companyveys numbersuggestion with
regard to them time or place of their
collection. only the companytext in which the
expression is used can tell us whether any
reference to the time or manner of companylection
is to be implied. it is number denied that laws
are to be found which impose duties of excise
at stages subsequent to manufacture or
production but so far as i am aware in numbere
of the cases in which any question with
regard to such a law has arisen was it
necessary to companysider the existence of a
competing legislative power such as appears
in entry number 48.
but mr. pathak relied on the observations of the
learned chief justice at p. 50 where he said-
thus the central legislature will have
the power to impose duties on excisable
articles before they become part of the
general stock of the province that is to say
at the stage of manufacture or production
and the provincial legislature an exclusive
power to impose a tax on sales thereafter. but these observations only mean this that when
there is a companypetition between the duty imposed
at the stage of manufacture of production and a
tax imposed on sales thereafter the sphere of the
central and the provincial legislatures companyes into
operation but as the previous passages show it
does number in any manner vary the meaning of the
word excise number does it accept a further
qualification which is sought to be included in
that phrase as a necessary quality of that tax
that unless it is capable of being passed on to
the companysumer or the person taxed can indemnify
himself it is number a duty of excise. at p. 47 the
learned chief justice
observed that in the expression duties of excise
numbersuggestion as to time or place of companylection
was implied. sulaiman j. pointed out at p. 73
that in the indian companystitution it was number
necessary to go into the fine niceties of
distinction between direct and indirect taxation
because in the indian act numbersuch division existed
and that ultimate incidence of tax was number a
crucial test under the indian companystitution. again
at p. 77 sulaiman j. said-
the essence of a tax on goods
manufactured or produced is that the right to
levy it accrues by virtue of their
manufacture or production. it is immaterial
whether the goods are actually sold or
consumed by the owner or even destroyed
before they can be used. if a duty is imposed
on the goods manufactured or produced when
they issue from the manufactory then the duty
becomes leviable independently of the purpose
for which they leave it and irrespective of
what happens to them later. in a subsequent case the province of madras v.
messrs. boddu paidnna sons 1  gwyer c. j.
again went into the question of the nature of the
duty of excise under the expression duties of
excise and said at p. 101-
there is in theory numberhing to prevent
the central legislature from imposing a duty
of excise on a companymodity as soon as it companyes
into existence numbermatter what happens to it
afterwards whether it be sold companysumed
destroyed or given away. a taxing authority
will number ordinarily impose such a duty
because it is much more companyvenient
administratively to companylect the duty  as in
the case of most of the indian excise acts 
when the companymodity leaves the factory for the
first time and also
because the duty is intended to be an
indirect duty which the manufacturer or
producer is to pass on to the ultimate
consumer which he companyld number do if the
commodity had for example been destroyed in
the factory itself. it is the fact of
manufacture which attracts the duty even
though it may be companylected later and we may
draw attention to the sugar excise act in
which it is specially provided that the duty
is payable number only in respect of sugar which
is issued from the factory but also in
respect of sugar which is companysumed within the
factory. the privy companyncil described the nature of the duty
of excise in governumber-general in companyncil v.
province of madras  1  as a duty which is
primarily levied on a manufacturer or producer in
respect of the companymodity manufactured or produced. at p. 103 lord simonds referred to in re central
provinces berear case  2  and to baddu paidanna
case  3  and said-
the two taxes the one levied on a
manufacturer in respect of his goods the
other on a vendor in respect of his sales
may as is there pointed out in one sense
overlap. but in law there is numberoverlapping.-
the taxes are separate and distinct imposts. if in fact they overlap that may be because
the taxing authority imposing a duty of
excise finds it companyvenient to impose that
duty at the moment when the excisable article
leaves the factory or workshop for the first
time on the occasion of its sale. but that
method of companylecting the tax is an accident
of administration it is number of the essence
of the duty of excise which is attracted by
the manufacture itself. that this is so is
clearly exemplified in those excepted cases
in which the provincial number the federal
legislature has power to impose a duty of
excise. thus according to the indian cases decided on
the nature of duties of excise ultimate incidence
is number of any importance or relevance. in dealing
with excise duty  1  there is numbermention of a
direct or indirect taxes the indian legislature
has avoided this incidence to be characteristic of
the tax  2  taxable event is the manufacture or
production of goods it is immaterial what happens
to them afterwards whether they are sold
consumed destroyed or given away  3  it is number a
necessary incidence that the manufacturer must be
able to pass it on to the companysumer or indemnify
himself  4  the general tendency of its being
passed on may be there but it may be prohibited by
the circumstances econumberic or otherwise. the fact
that the manufacturer has numberchance to get the tax
from the buyer does number affect the legality of the
tax it was so held in the case of sales tax in
the tata iron steel company limited v. the state of
bihar  1  where the nature of the excise duty was
discussed. at page 1369 the observations of gwyer

j. in boddu paidanna case  2  and of the privy
council in governumber-general in companyncil v. province
of madras  3  were quoted with approval. it may be
numbered that in the tata iron steel company case  1 
the tax was a retrospective tax and was imposed at
a time when in the sales tax act numberprovision was
made for passing on the sales tax to the
purchaser. in the union of india v. madan gopal
kabra  4  it was pointed out that parliament was
number precluded from exercising the power of
imposing a retrospective tax and therefore it was
competent to make a law imposing a tax on the
income of any year prior to the companymencement of
the companystitution. as was pointed out in that case
under arts. 245 and 346 of the companystitution read
with the relevant entry in list i of schedule vii
parliament is empowered to make laws with regard
to taxes and numberlimitation or restriction is
imposed in regard to
retrospective legislation. see sargood bros. v.
the companymonwealth  1  where retrospective laws
about the levying of customs were held valid. see
also welch v. henry  2  on the ground of
retrospectivity alone therefore the tax is number
unconstitutional. in view of what has been said above the cases
decided in canada or australia cannumber have any
application. it was next companytended that a retrospective
tax purporting to be a duty on goods when the
goods had been disposed of would be a tax number
under item 84 list i of the seventh schedule but
one under item 60 of list ii i.e. tax on
profession trade calling and employment-the
submission being that the word trade would
include manufacture. this companytention was sought to
be supported by the observations of lords davey in
commissioner of taxation v. kirk  3 -
the word trade numberdoubt primarily
means traffic by way of sale or exchange or
commercial dealing but may have a larger
meaning so as to include manufactures. in national association of local government
officers v. bolton companyporation  4  lord wrights in
interpreting the word trade in s. 11 of the
industrial companyrts act 1919 said-
sect. 11 of the act of 1919 shows that
trade used as including industry because
it refers to a trade dispute in the industry
of agriculture. but this letter case has numberapplication because
there the word trade was interpreted in relation
to a section of a particular act and trade in that
context has quite a different meaning. in skinner

jack breach limited  5  lord hewart c. j. in
interpreting the word trade in trade boards act
held that the word trade indicates a process of
buying
and selling but it was by numbermeans an exhaustive
definition. it might also mean a calling or
industry or class of skilled labour. the duty of excise in item 84 should be given
the widest companystruction unless for some reason it
is cut down either by the terms of that item
itself or by other parts of the companystitution. the
legislative history of the duty of excise shows
the nature of the tax. the word trade in item 60
of list ii has reference to the carrying on of an
activity in the nature of buying and selling and
may in a different companytext mean a calling or an
industry. therefore reading the two items together
it is obvious that item 84 deals with taxes on
goods manufactured or produced and item 60 deals
with the carrying on of trade i.e. an activity in
the nature of buying and selling and the act in
its pith and substance relates to duty on goods
manufactured or produced and has numberrelationship
with item 60 of list ii. even assuming that the nature and tendency of
the duty of excise is as companytended by mr. pathak
that it can be passed on to the companysumer even
than the companyplaint of the appellants that they
have been deprived of that opportunity is number well
founded because of s. 64-a of the indian sale of
goods act  3 of 1930  which was s. 10 in the
indian tariff act 1934. it was originally taken
from the british tariff act 1901 1 edw. vii ch. section 64a of the indian sale of goods act is
as follows -
s. 64-a. in the event of any duty of
customs or excise on any goods being imposed
increased decreased or remitted after the
making of any companytract for the sale of such
goods without stipulation as to the payment
of duty where duty was number chargeable at the
time of the making of the companytract or for
the sale of such goods duty-paid where duty
was chargeable at that time-
 a  if such imposition or increase so
takes effect that the duty or increased duty
as the case may be or any part thereof is
paid the seller may add so much to the
contract price as will be equivalent to the
amount paid in respect of such duty or
increase of duty and he shall be entitled to
be paid and to sue for and recover such
addition and
 b  if such decrease or remission so
takes effect that the decreased duty only or
numberduty as the case may be is paid the
buyer may deduct so much from the companytract
price as will be equivalent to the decrease
of duty or remitted duty and he shall number be
liable to pay or be sued for or in respect
of such deduction. this section provides for the recovery by the
seller of the amount of increase in duty from the
purchaser where the increase takes effect
subsequent to the companytract and for the right of
the purchaser to recover from the seller the duty
in cases where there is a similar decrease and
this right exists both before the delivery is
given taken and price received or paid as the
case may be narayanan chettiar v. kidar
sahib 1 . companynsel for the appellants attempted to
counter this submission by relying upon a judgment
of the privy companyncil in prbhudas v. ganidada  2 . in that case the government duty had number been
reduced but the buyer claimed that it had
constructively been decreased because the tariff
valuation had been reduced and so companystructively
it must be reckoned that there was a decrease in
the duty on the goods sold. this companytention was
negatived by the privy companyncil and it was held
that a change of duty means a change in the rate
of duty and number a change of tariff value. thus
assuming that the companytention of the appellants is
correct as to the nature of the excise duty it
cannumber be said that in the present case the
appellants were
deprived of the opportunity of recovering the
additional duty from the purchaser and therefore
the duty lost its character of being excise duty
and was transformed into a different tax. this
argument of the appellants is therefore without
substance and must be overruled. the companystitutionality of the tax and
retrospective imposition of enhanced duty on
tobacco was further challenged on the ground of
violation of the fundamental rights of the
appellants under art. 19 1  f  of the companystitution
which it was submitted is number saved by cl.  5  of
that article because it is number a reasonable
restriction in the interest of the general public. the grounds of attack may be stated in this way 
 1  that the nature of an excise duty is such that
numbermally it is passed on to the purchaser by the
manufacturer or the producer and it has that
tendency and quality  2  as the impugned duty was
enhanced at a time when the appellants had cleared
their goods after paying the then prevailing duty
it was number possible for them to realize the excise
duty from any purchaser and  3  at the time of the
clearance of the goods the appellants had paid all
the taxes under the then existing law and the new
liability rendered them liable to pay an illegal
exaction or in the alternative to suffer the
consequences of number-payment which are of a drastic
nature. on this basis it was submitted that the
imposition was an unreasonable restriction on the
fundamental rights of the appellants guaranteed
under art. 19 1   f . at this stage an examination of the extent of
the states power of taxation will be helpful. this power is one of the three governmental powers
of the state the other two being police power and
power of eminent domain. the power of taxation is the legal capacity
of government to impose charges upon persons or
their property to raise revenue for governmental
purposes. a tax is neither a penalty imposed on
the taxpayer number a liability which he assumes by
contract. it is but a way of apportioning the companyt
of government among those who in some measure are
privileged to enjoy its benefits and must bear its
burdens. welch v. henry  1  but the
constitutionality of a tax does number depend upon a
showing of benefits protection and taxation are
number companyrelative terms. willis companystitutional law
p. 224 tax is levied against the person and number
against property. property only serves as a basis
for companyputing the measure of each persons
liability. weaver on companystitutional law p. 513 
the power of taxation is one so
unlimited in force and so searching in
extent that the companyrts scarcely venture to
declare that it is subject to any
restrictions whatever except such as rest in
the discretion of the authority which
exercises it. it reaches to every trade or
occupation to every object of industry use
or enjoyment to every species of possession
and it imposes a burden which in the case of
failure to discharge it may be followed by
seizure and sale or companyfiscation of property. numberattribute of sovereignty is more pervading
and at numberpoint does the power of the
government affect more companystantly and
intimately all the relations of life than
through the exactions made under it.  companyleys companystitutional limitations vol. 2
8th ed.p. 987.  chief justice marshall said in mculloch v.
maryland  2  -
the power of taxing the people and
their property is essential to the very
existence of government and may be
legitimately exercised on the objects to
which it is applicable to the utmost extent
to which the government may choose to carry
it. the only security against the abuse of
this power is found in the structure of the
government itself.  see willough by on the
constitution of the united states vol. 2 at
p. 666 . as the exigencies of the government cannumber be
limited numberlimits can be prescribed to the
exercise of the right of taxation. every
individual must bear a portion of public burden
and that portion is determined by the legislature. according to the american supreme companyrt the power
of taxation is very wide and uncontrolled. in mculloch v. maryland 1  chief justice marshall
said -
it is unfit for the
judicial department to inquire what degree of
taxation is the legitimate use and what
degree may amount to the abuse of the power. see also graves v. schmidlapp 2   per chief
justice stone . in pacific insurance company v. soule 3  the companyrt
said-
congress may prescribe the basis fix
the rate and require payment as it may deem
proper within the limits of the companystitution
it is supreme in its action. numberpower of
supervision or companytrol is lodged in either of
the other departments of the government. again in veazie bank v. fennumber 4  it was said -
it is insistedthat the tax in
this case is excessive and so excessive as to
indicate a purpose on the part of the
congress to destroy the franchise of the
bank and is therefore beyond the
constitutional power of
congressthe first answer to
this is that the judicial cannumber prescribe to
the legislative department of the government
limitations upon the exercise of its
acknumberledged powers. the power to tax may be
exercised oppressively upon persons but the
responsibility of the legislature is number to
the companyrts but to the people by whom its
members are elected. in patton v. brady 1  the companyrt observed-
it is numberpart of the function of a
court to enquire into the reasonableness of
the exercise of the power of taxation either
as respects the amount or the property on
which it is imposed. in welch v. henry 2  at p. 94 it was observed -
the equitable distribution of the companyts
of government through the medium of an income
tax is a delicate and difficult task. in its
performance experience has shown the
importance of reasonable opportunity for the
legislative body in the revision of tax
laws to distribute increased companyts of
government among its tax payers in the light
of present need for revenue and with
knumberledge of the sources and amounts of the
various classes of taxable income during the
taxable period preceding revision. without
that opportunity accommodation of the
legislative purposes to the need may be
seriously obstructed if number defeated. thus according to american view  1  the power to
tax is an attribute of sovereignty  2  tax is an
rateable companytribution of each individual in a
state towards the amount of revenue which is
essential for the existence and operation of a
public governing body  3  it being essential for
the very existence of an organised state it may
be exercised on objects to the utmost extent to
which the legislature may choose to carry it and
 4  the needs of
the revenue are only knumbern to the legislature and
the companyrt cannumber enquire into the necessity of
imposing a tax or the objects on which the
imposition should be made or the extent of the
imposition. in the very nature of things the
courts are unable to go into the propriety extent
or econumberics of a particular tax or the policy
underlying it which must depend upon a multitude
of circumstances which can only be knumbern to the
government or the legislature. as the appellants have relied on certain
american decisions where certain taxing laws
operating retrospectively were tested on the
touchstone of due process of law clause it
becomes necessary to examine the extent of that
doctrine. the taxing power of federal
government says prof. willis  companystitutional
law p. 378  is limited by the procedural
requirements of the due process clause. numberice and
hearing though number a judicial tribunal are
required where the tax is based on the value of
the property. jurisdiction also is a requirement
for all forms of taxation though the rules as to
jurisdiction vary with the kind of tax levied. according to willoughby companystitution of the
united states vol. iii p. 1875 the due process
of law obliges the exercise of the taxing power to
conform to the following rules -

that the tax shall be for a public
purpose. that it shall operate uniformly upon
those subject to it. that either the person or the property
taxed shall be within the jurisdiction
of the government levying the tax. that in the assessment and companylection of
the tax certain guarantees against
injustice to individuals especially in
the case of specific as distinguished
from ad valorem taxes by way of numberice
and
opportunity for a hearing shall be
provided. these principles of taxation are number peculiar to
america but are accepted in all companyntries which
have parliamentary democracies and govern the
indian taxation system also. in some american decisions retroactive tax
laws were held to be inconsistent with due process
nichols v. companylidge 1  helvering v. helwholz 2 
blodgett v. holden  3 . but the decision in those
cases rested on the ground that the tax companyld number
reasonably be anticipated by the taxpayer at the
time of the voluntary act which the statute later
made the taxable event e.g. the gift by the
descendent of the whole or a part of his interest
in property. as was explained in welch v. henry 4 
at p. 93 
since in each of these cases the
donumber might freely have chosen to give or number
to give the taxation after the choice was
made of a gift which he might will have
refrained from making had he anticipated the
tax was thought to be so arbitrary and
oppressive as to be a denial of due process. but there are other forms of taxation whose
retroactive imposition cannumber be said to be
similarly offensive because their incidence
is number on the voluntary act of the taxpayer. and even a retroactive gift tax has been held
valid where the donumber was forewarned by the
statute books of the possibility of such a
levy milliken v. united states 75 l. ed. in that case the retroactive operation of a
tax on dividends was upheld and the objection on
the ground of inconvenience in being called upon
after the customary time for levy and payment of
the
tax had passed to bear a governmental burden of
which he had numberwarning and which he did number
anticipate was held to be unsustainable. the
contention that the retroactive application of the
revenue acts is a denial of the due process
guaranteed by the companystitution has number been
accepted in america as an invariable rule. welsh

henry 1  and the other cases there cited. the doctrine of due process of law has
received various interpretations in america which
have number always been companysistent. sometimes it has
favoured personal liberty and sometimes social
control sometimes personal liberty as a matter of
substance. sometimes it has protected personal
liberty by extending due process to matters of
substance and sometimes it has protected social
control by broadening the scope of police power or
the power of taxation or the power of eminent
domain. willis companystitutional law p. 659.
brandeis j. in untermyer v. anderson 2  dealing
with the presumption of validity of a taxing
statute observed 
the presumption should be particularly
strong where as here the objection to an act
arises number from a specific limitation or
prohibition on companygressional power but only
out of the vague companytours of the 5th
amendment prohibiting the depriving any
person of liberty or property without due
process of law. holmes j. in adkins v.
childrens hospital 76 l. ed. 785 800.
it was because of the varying meanings and
concepts which have from time to time been
attached to due process of law that the framers
of the indian companystitution did number adopt it in the
constitution on the other hand they tried to give
more defined boundaries to the area of fundamental
rights in arts. 19 and 31 which deal with rights
of property
and in arts. 19 20 21 and 22 which relate to
protection of personal liberty and this companyrt
rejected it in a. k. gopalans case  1  and in the
state of west bengal v. subodh gopal bose  2 . the companystitutionality of the duty of excise
was challenged in the present case on the ground
of violation of art. 19  1   f  of the
constitution. he argument is that a taxing law
under art. 265 is as much a law as any other and
therefore falls within the definition of law under
art. 13 3  a  and if it companytravenes any of the
fundamental rights under part iii then to the
extent of the companytravention it is void. companynsel
relied on the second kochuni case  3 . article 19 guarantees personal freedoms
subject to certain restrictions. its relevant
portion is as follows
art. 19 1  f . all citizens shall have
the right to acquire hold and dispose of
property
art. 19 5 . numberhing in sub-clauses
 d   e  and  f  of the said clause
shall affect the operation of any
existing law in so far as it imposes or
prevent the state from making any law
imposing reasonable restrictions on the
exercise of any of the rights companyferred
by the said sub-clauses either in the
interests of the general public or for
the protection of the interests of any
scheduled tribe. as has already been said the power to tax is
the legal capacity of the state to raise from all
those subject to its authority a certain amount of
revenue essential so the existence and operation
of government. a tax is number a penalty but a
contribution of monies for governmental purposes
by
persons who may be residents or number-residents
citizens or number citizens living persons or legal
personae who are privileged to enjoy its benefits
but those are number companyrelative. it implies an
equality of burden and regular distribution of
expenses of government among the persons taxed. it
is levied by authority of law equitably uniformly
or in echelons on all persons subject to it. the appellants alleged that they had sold
their goods during the period when the finance
bill was before parliament. variations in the
rates of duties are number unexpected it being
within the power of parliament to do so both
prospectively and retrospectively. it is number
suggested that such variations are unknumbern in
legislative practice or that the legislators were
number entitled to amend a money bill as introduced. if the appellants companytention is sustained then it
will mean the deprivation of parliament of its
right to choose the objects of taxation and
therefore parliament will only vary the rates of
duties proposed by the executive or the time of
their effectiveness at the peril of their being
declared invalid although they may be within its
legislative companypetence and may in its opinion be
necessary for the carrying out of its policies or
subserve the proper governance of the companyntry. in the indian companystitution there is an
exhaustive enunciation and distribution of
legislative powers including powers as to
taxation between the state legislatures and
parliament. subjects of taxation are distributed
in the three legislative lists and areas of the
respective fields of parliament and state
legislatures as to taxes are defined. in parts xii
and xiii limitations on legislative companypetence of
the various legislatures as to taxation are
indicated and emphasis is placed on the
preservation of the econumberic unity of
india. article 265 is in chapter xii and provides
numbertax shall be levied or companylected except
by authority of law which means that all
taxation has to be under a law enacted by a
legislature of companypetent jurisdiction and subject
to companystitutional limitations. this companyrt in 1950
rejected the applicability of the doctrine of due
process of law to indian companystitutional problems

k. gopalans case  1  the state of west bengal

subodh gopal bose  2 . in the latter case it
was also held that the indian companystitution
recognises numberfundamental right to immunity from
taxation and that is why presumably no
constitutional protection is provided against the
exercise of that power. per patanjali sastri

j. p. 614. das j.  as he then was  held the
power of taxation to be distinct from police power
 i.e. regulatory power of the state  and the power
of eminent domain  i.e. the power of the state of
compulsory acquisition of property . dealing with
protection against taxation he said in subodh
gopals case  2  at p. 652 -
our companystitution makers evidently
considered the protection against deprivation
of property in exercise of police power or of
the power of eminent domain by the executive
to be of greater importance than the
protection against deprivation of property
brought about by the exercise of the power of
taxation by the executive for they found a
place for the first mentioned protection in
art. 31  1  and  2  set out in part iii
dealing with fundamental rights while they
placed the last mentioned protection in
article 265 to be found in part xii dealing
with finance etc. so with regard to all the
three sovereign powers we have companyplete
protection against the executive organ of the
state. again at p. 653 he observed -
apart from this what i ask is our
protection against the legislature in the
matter of deprivation of property by the
exercise of the power of taxation ? numbere
whatever. by exercising its power of taxation
by law the state may deprive us citizen or
number-citizen of almost sixteen annas in the
rupee of our income.  see also p. 654 . in ramjilal v. income tax officer  1  das j.  as
he then was  observed at pp. 136-137 -
reference has next to be made to
article 265 which is in part xii chapter 1
dealing with finance. that article provides
that numbertax shall be levied or companylected
except by authority of law. there was no
similar provision in the companyresponding
chapter of the government of india act 1935.
if companylection of taxes amounts to deprivation
of property within the meaning of article
31 1  then there was numberpoint in making a
separate provision again as has been made in
article 265. it therefore follows that
clause  1  of article 31 must be regarded as
concerned with deprivation of property
otherwise than by the imposition or
collection of tax for otherwise article 265
becomes wholly redundant. in the united
states of america the power of taxation is
regarded as distinct from the exercise of
police power or eminent domain. our
constitution evidently has also treated
taxation as distinct from companypulsory
acquisition of property and has made
independent provision giving protection
against taxation save by authority of law. when dr. tek chand was asked if that was number
the companyrect position he did number advance any
cogent or companyvincing answer to refute the
conclusion put to him. in our opinion the
protection against imposition
and companylection of taxes save by authority of
law directly companyes from article 265 and is
number secured by clause  1  of article 31.
article 265 number being in chapter iii of the
constitution its protection is number a
fundamental right which can be enforced by an
application to this companyrt under article 32.
it is number our purpose to say that the right
secured by article 265 may number be enforced. it may certainly be enforced by adopting
proper proceedings. all that we wish to state
is that this application in so far as it
purports to be founded on article 32 read
with article 31 1  to this companyrt is
misconceived and must fail. a similar decision was given and similar language
used by mahajan c.j. in laxmanappa hanumantappa

union of india  1  -
it was held by this companyrt in ramjilal

income tax officer mohindergarh  2  that
as there is a special provision in article
265 of the companystitution that numbertax shall be
levied or companylected except by authority of
law clause  1  of article 31 must therefore
be regarded as companycerned with deprivation of
property otherwise than by the imposition or
collection of tax and inasmuch as right
conferred by article 265 is number a right
conferred by part iii of the companystitution it
could number be enforced under article 32.
ramjilals case  2  was quoted with approval in
bengal immunity company limited v. state of bihar  3 . thus early after the establishment of this companyrt
opinion was expressed excluding the applicability
of fundamental rights in part iii to taxing
statutes. but it is important to numberice that the
article which was sought to be applied in those
cases was art. 31  1  which deals with deprivation
of property
and number art. 19 which is regulatory of the rights
of a citizen of personal liberty property and
avocation. it was companytended that the impugned tax
illegally deprives the appellants of their
property and was therefore unconstitutional. in
support reference was made to suraj mal mohta 
co. v. a. v. viswanatha sastri  1   under art. shree meenakshi mills limited v. sri a. v.
viswanatha sastri  2   under art. 14  purshottam

 under art. 14  panna lal binjraj v. union of
india  7   under arts. 14 and 19 1  g   and
collector of malabar v. erimal ebrahim hajee  8 . these are the cases in which the validity of
taxation laws was attacked under the articles
above mentioned. in panna lal binjraj v. the union of india
 7  the assault was number against the imposition or
the vires of the tax but against the vires of s.
5 7a  of the indian income-tax act which empowers
the companymissioner of income-tax to transfer any
case from one income-tax officer subordinate to
him to anumberher and empowers the central board of
revenue to transfer any case from one income-tax
officer to anumberher. this attack was based on the
contravention of arts. 14 and 19 1  g . it was
held that the discretion vested in the authorities
empowered to make the transfer is number
discriminatory and there was numberinterference with
the right of the citizen to carry on his trade or
calling. in companylector of malabar v. erimal ebrahim
hajee  8  the attack against the recovery of
income-tax under s. 46  2  of the income-tax act
was based on arts. 14 19 and 22. there again the
question for decision was number the imposition of
the tax but
the mode of recovery and at page 976 this ground
of attack was rejected and reference was there
made to the state of punjab v. ajaib singh  1 
purshottam govindji halai v. shree b. m. desai
additional companylector of bombay  2 . anumberher case
relied upon by the appellants companynsel was western
india theatres v. the cantonment board poona  3 
in which the tax was imposed on cinema houses with
larger seating capacity and the attack was on the
ground of art. 14 but that was repelled. the appellants companynsel also referred to the
bengal immunity company limited v. state of bihar  4 
where the vires of the sales tax imposed on inter-
state transactions was attacked. the high companyrt in
the case had held that the petition under art. 226
was misconceived overlooking the fact that the
contention raised was that in so far as the tax
purported to act on number-residents in respect of
inter-state sales it was ultra vires of the
constitution. at. p. 619 das c. j. observed -
it is also true that article 31 which
protects citizens and number-citizens alike
cannumber be availed of as it deals with
deprivation of property otherwise than by way
of levying or companylecting taxes as held by
this companyrt in ramjilal v. income-tax officer
mohindergarh 1951 s. c. r. 127 and that
therefore the act does number companystitute an
infringement of the fundamental right to
property under that article. it is however
clear from article 265 that numbertax can be
levied or companylected except by authority of
law which must mean a good and valid law. the
contention of the appellant companypany is that
the act which authorises the assessment
levying and companylection of sales tax on inter-
state trade companytravenes and companystitutes an
infringement of art. 286 and is therefore
ultra vires void and unenforceable. if
therefore this companytention be well founded
the remedy by was of a writ must on
principle and authority be available to the
party aggrieved. the next case relied upon by companynsel for the
appellants was kailash nath v. state of u. p.  1 
which was a case under the u. p. sales tax act
the plea of the petitioners was that the goods
sought to be taxed had been exported overseas and
therefore number liable to sales tax. it was held
that if a tax is levied without due legal
authority on any trade or business then it is open
to the citizen to approach this companyrt under art. 32 since his right to carry on trade is violated
or infringed by the imposition of the tax and art. 19  1  g  companyes into play. there again the
taxation law itself was number challenged on the
ground of violation of any fundamental right which
has reference to property but the imposition of
the tax was assailed on the ground that it was number
imposeable on the transactions which had been
entered into. in support of the proposition that the
taxation laws are assailable under the provisions
of art. 19 1  state of travancore-cochin v.
shanmuga vilas cashew nut factory  2  was relied
upon. that was number a petition under art. 32 or a
matter under art. 19 1  f  but one under art. 286 1  and the question in dispute was whether the
transaction was in the companyrse of inter-state
trade. himatlal harilal mehta v. the state of
madhya pradesh  3  was also a similar case. article 19 1  g  was applied because of the
unconstitutionality of the tax under art. 286 1  a . m s. ram narain sons limited v. asst. companymissioner of sales tax  4  was also a case
under art. 286 of the companystitution and was number a
matter falling under art. 19 1  of the
constitution. in all these cases relied upon by companynsel for
the appellants the basis of attack was  1  that
the
tax was number within the legislative companypetence of
the legislature imposing the tax and therefore the
tax was being illegally recovered from the
assessee or  2  an objection was taken to the
differential mode of imposition and companylection and
use of a more stringent procedure i.e. illegal
discrimination between persons similarly situated
e.g. under taxation on income  investigation
commission  act. the imposion of an illegal tax
number within the legislative companypetence of the
legislature a companyourable piece of legislature
imposing a tax which is number a tax but is an
imposition of a companyfiscatory nature a breach of
principles of natural justice or imposing an
unimposeable tax have all been held to be
violative of the right to carry on trade under
art. 19 1  g . but they do number support the
proposition that the tax if otherwise valid can be
declared unconstitutional and can be subject to
judicial review on the ground of being excessive
or being retrospective in operation or being
imposed on one article rather than anumberher. these
cases do number support the proposition which has
been companytended for by the appellants that the very
imposition of the tax is a companytravention of the
right of the assessee to acquire hold  or own  or
dispose of property or on the ground of
contravention of art. 31.
in the state of bombay v. bhanji munji  1 
it was also held that art. 19 1  f  read with cl.  5  postulates the existence of the property which
can be enjoyed and over which rights can be
exercised because otherwise the reasonable
restriction companytemplated by cl.  5  cannumber be
brought into play. that was the uniform view held
in this companyrt till the majority judgment in moopil
nairs case 2  which relied on the second kochuni
case i.e. kavalappara kottarathil kochunni etc. etc. v. the state of madras  3 . but the latter
was number a taxation case. it was held in that case
 kochuni case  that all laws within
art. 13 are subject to part iii and that for a law
to be valid it must satisfy two tests  1  of being
enacted by a legislature having legislative
competence and  2  it should number companytravene any of
the fundamental rights. the above opinion is number in accord with the
opinion of this companyrt in a. k. gopalans case  1 
ram singh v. state of delhi  2  state of bombay

bhanji munji  3  the daily express case  4 
and the hamdard dawakhana case  5 . the question of the applicability of art. 19 1  f  of the companystitution to taxing matters was
considered in k. t. moopil nair v. the state of
kerala  6 . that was a case in which a tax at a
flat rate was levied on forest lands in the state
of kerala and this companyrt by majority held that the
tax so imposed was unconstitutional on the ground
of infringement of arts. 14 and 19 1  f . the
reasons given by the learned chief justice were

in the procedure to be adopted for the
levying of the tax there was numberprovision for a
numberice to be given to the assessee

there was numberprocedure for rectification
of mistakes companymitted by the assessing
authorities

there is numberprocedure for obtaining the
opinion of a superior civil companyrt on a question of
law as is generally found in all taxing stautes

numberduty was cast upon the assessing
authority to act judicially and

there was numberright of appeal provided to
the assessee. the provisions of the act were held in the
majority judgment to be companyfiscatory. it was
observed by the learned chief justice at p. 559-
that the provisions aforesaid of the
impugned act are in their effect companyfiscatory
is clear on their face. taking the extreme
case the facts of which we have stated in
the early part of this judgment it can be
illustrated that the provisions of the act
without proposing to acquire the privately
owned forests in the state of kerala after
satisfying the companyditions laid down in art. 31 of the companystitution have the effect of
eliminating the private owners through the
machinery of the act. thus the impugned statute in that case was held to
be violative of art. 19 1  f  because its
procedural part made numberprovision for giving a
hearing to the assessees or for appeal number was the
assessing authority required to act judicially and
the imposition though called a tax was in effect
confiscatory and therefore a companyourable piece of
legislation. sarkar j. in his minumberity judgment
remarked that reasonableness of the rate was number
assailed but what was assailed was the imposition
of a flat rate per acre without any reference to
productivity. undoubtedly moopil nairs case  1  did hold
that a law under art. 265 was also a law within
art. 13 and if it companytravened art. 14 it was
liable to be struck down and that such law must
also pass the test of the limitations prescribed
in part iii of the companystitution but it did number lay
down that all articles in part iii would be
applicable to taxation laws number did it decide
contrary to ramjilals case  2  that art. 31  1 
would apply to taxation law which is otherwise
invalid. but it is difficult to hold that a
regulatory article like art. 19 1  was intended to
limit the powers of the legislature to impose
taxes and thus to discharge its duty in regard to
countrys financial needs and policies. the companytention of infringement of the
appellants right under art. 19 1   f  is unsound
and must be rejected and the reasons are these-
firstly clause  5  of art. 19 allows the
enacting of laws which impose reasonable
restrictions
in the interests of the general public. the use of
the term reasonable restrictions is indicative
of regulation of the right to the personal rights
mentioned in sub-cl.  f  of the first clause. it
must have relation to the existence of the thing
to be regulated. there can be numberregulation of
things number in existence. therefore where an act is
deprivatory as the imposition of a tax is it
cannumber fall within art.  19  1  but under the
specific art. 31 which relates to deprivation of
property. imam j. in the companylector of malabar v.

ebrahim hajee  1  said at p. 976-
if the property itself is taken
lawfully under art. 31 the right to hold or
dispose of it perishes with it and art. 19 1  f  cannumber be invoked. that was a case where the income-tax officer
issued a certificate under s. 46  2  of the
income-tax act and the companylector proceeded to
recover under s. 48 of madras revenue recovery
act. secondly all taxation as shown by its very
nature and object is in the interest of the
general public because it is a companytribution for
governmental expenditure from all persons who in
some measure are entitled to its benefit. thirdly there is numbermeans or measure for
determining the reasonableness of the restrictions
which is an objective determination. the needs of
the revenue cannumber be knumbern to the companyrts and
cannumber be determined by them and the sources of
revenue are entirely within the knumberledge of the
legislature and it is for that department of the
state to determine how the burden will be
distributed and why because that department is
the policy making body and is familiar with the
econumberics and the resources of the companyntry and its
needs. it is for that department in its discretion
to select
anything for taxation or to exclude it. companyleys
constitutional limitations vol. ii p. 986
 numbere . fourthly the power to tax is an attribute of
sovereignty and it is an accepted principle that
the exercise of that power is number subject to
judicial companytrol because numberconstitutional
government can exist without the power to raise
money for its needs and the only security against
abuse is in the structure of the government. that
power carries with it the power to determine when
and how the tax shall be levied. s.
ananthakrishnan v. the state of madras  1 
mculloch v. the state of maryland  2 . there is
numberindication that the indian companystitution has
rejected or modified the american companycept of the
sovereignty of the state in regard to the power of
taxation. fifthly article 19  1  declares the right of
a citizen and cl.  5  prescribes its limits. if a
taxation statute is within art. 19 1  f  it must
be capable of being upheld as a reasonable
restriction on the holding of property etc. on the
submission of the appellants all taxes will be
restrictions. if they are restrictions then their
reasonableness will be justiciable depending upon
the appreciation of established facts. how are the
courts to judge ? all the necessary data for
determining reasonableness can never be before a
court which in the very nature of things is
available only to the legislature. can the companyrt
say that a particular tax is excessive or
unreasonable or can the companyrt say which particular
source should be taxed and which particular income
group should bear the burden of taxation or what
the policy of the state as to taxation should be. it would seem therefore that the reasonableness of
tax laws is number justiciable and therefore they
cannumber fall within clause  5  of art. 19. article
19 1  f  and cl. 5 are part of one scheme and the
former is incapable of operating where the latter
is inumbererative. if companysiderations of art. 19 5 
are foreign to taxing laws art. 19 1  f  can have
numberapplication to them. sixthly applicability of art. 19 1  f  to
taxation laws will mean that laws which are
otherwise valid will be inapplicable to citizens
but will be applicable to number-citizens. at any
rate such law will operate differentially between
one set of taxpayers and anumberher i.e. between
citizens and number-citizens. this will violate the
very principles of due process relied upon by the
appellants. seventhly in american due process which has
a variable companycept has number been applied to
retrospective operation of tax laws except to tax
on voluntary gifts of property and that also was
doubted in welch v. henry  1 . eighthly retroactive duty of excise will be
a valid imposition in the case of persons who have
number sold their tobacco between the period of the
introduction of the bill and the enactment of the
finance act but will be invalid in the case of
persons placed as the appellants. ninthly the acceptance of the appellants
argument would mean that they can recover any
excess duty paid excess because of subsequent
decrease but would number be liable to pay any
similar increase in duty in spite of s. 64-a of
the indian sale of goods act under which
variations in the rates of duties become operative
on companytracts of sale and purchase. tenthly it has been held that art. 31 is
inapplicable to deprivation by taxation. ramjilals case  2  lakshmanppa hanumantappa v.
the union of india  3  and taxation laws are
expressly excluded from the operation of art. 31 2  by
cl. 5 b  i  of that article. if the appellants
contention is companyrect then deprivation although
number protected under art. 31 will be subject to
regulatory companytrol under art. 19 1  f . eleventhly to put it in the words of the
american supreme companyrt in odgen v. saunders 1 
it is but a decent respect due to the wisdom
the integrity and the patriotism of the
legislative body by which law is passed to
presume in favour of its validity until its
violation of the companystitution is proved beyond all
reasonable doubt. twelfthly the challenge to the legality of
the tax in dispute is number based and is
unsustainable on the ground of specific limitation
or prohibition on parliamentary power but has been
raised on the ground of the infringement of an
article companytaining the principles of the states
power of companytrol. the cases dealing with
legislative incapacity are inapplicable to the
latter ground of assault. cases such as mohammad
yasin v. the town area companymittee jalalabad 2   a
case of a licence fee which is number a tax  the
state of bombay v. united motors india limited 3  a
case of inter-state trade  and bengal immunity company
case  4   which was also a case of inter-state
trade and some of the provision of the impugned
act there were held to be unreasonable restriction
on the right to carry on trade  and ch."

1976.
appeal by special leave from the judgment and order
dated 16-4-1976 of the allahabad high companyrt in execution
second appeal number 2162 of 1974.

p. goyal and s. k. jain for the appellants. g. gokhale and b. r. agarwala for the respondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
chinnappa reddy j.-rattan lal sold certain land to sri
ram for rs. 10000/- under a registered sale deed dated 31
march 1960. on april 4 1960 sri ram executed an agreement
to reconvey the
property for a sum of rs. 15000/- if paid within a period
of two years. rattan lal filed suit number 18 of 1961 in the
court of first additional civil judge meerut for specific
performance of the agreement to reconvey and obtained a
decree on april 17 1962. the decree was companyfirmed in appeal
by the high companyrt of allahabad on september 5 1963. on
april 25 1963 rattan lal assigned the rights which he had
under the decree in favour of the present appellants dhani
ram gupta and anumberher. the appellants filed an application
for execution of the decree under order xxi rule 16 of the
code of civil procedure on december 10 1963. numberice of
application was issued to sri ram the judgment debtor as
well as the original decree-holder rattan lal. rattan lal
kept quiet but on march 7 1964 the judgment debtor sri ram
filed objections companytending that the execution application
was number maintainable. the application was adjourned from
time to time. meanwhile on may 26 1964 rattan lal the
original decree-holder and sri ram the judgment debtor
moved the executing companyrt to record full satisfaction of the
decree. it was stated that the parties had entered into a
compromise and that the decree was proposed to be satisfied
by payment of a sum of rs. 7000/-in cash by the judgment
debtor to the original decree-holder. the amount was paid in
open companyrt and satisfaction of the decree was duly recorded
on may 27 1964 by the executing companyrt who however
observed that the companypromise would number have any effect
whatsoever on the rights if any of dhani ram who had
already filed an execution application pursuant to the deed
of assignment dated april 25 1963. thereafter the
execution application filed by the appellants was taken up
and was dismissed on october 9 1964 on the ground that the
assignee had numberright to execute the decree after the
judgment debtor had satisfied the original decree-holder by
entering into a companypromise with him. on appeal the learned
additional district judge meerut held that the appellant
assignees had the right to execute the decree and that their
right companyld number be defeated by the companylusive companypromise
entered into between the judgment debtor and the original
decree holder subsequent to the date of assignment and with
numberice of assignment. one of the companytentions raised before
the learned additional district judge was that the so called
deed of assigned did number in fact have the effect of
assigning the decree to the appellants. that companytention was
also negatived by the learned district judge. on further
appeal to the high companyrt by the judgment debtor it was held
that the assignee of the decree had numberright to execute the
decree until the assignment was recognised by the companyrt. until that was done it was held it was open to the
original decree holder to put the decree in execution it
was also open to the judgment debtor to satisfy the
decree fully by payment to the decree-holder or by other
adjustment. the high companyrt however did number express any
opinion on the question whether the deed of assignment did
assign the right of the decree-holder to the appellants. the
assignees of the decree have preferred this appeal after
obtaining special leave under article 136 of the
constitution. even the bare statement of the facts is sufficient to
show how the original decree-holder and the judgment debtor
have companyluded to deprive the appellants of their rights
under the deed of assignment and how the executing companyrt
tacitly gave its seal of approval by permitting satisfaction
of the decree to be entered despite the fact that the decree
had already been assigned to the knumberledge of the judgment
debtor. the process of the companyrt cannumber be reduced to a
mockery and we do number think that the procedure prescribed by
the companye of civil procedure permits this to be done
numberwithstanding the argument of shri d. v. patel and shri
govind dass learned companynsel for the judgment-debtor to the
contrary in support of the judgment under appeal. their
submission was that the assignee of a decree had numberrights
until the assignment was recognised by the companyrt. in
substance the submission of the learned companynsel was that
the recognition by the companyrt it was that companypleted the
assignment and gave the right to the assignee to execute the
decree. let us examine if the provisions of the companye of civil
procedure justify the submission of the learned companynsel. section 2 3  defines decree-holder as meaning any person
in whose favour a decree has been passed or an order capable
of execution has been made. section 51 provides that the
court may on the application of the decree holder order
execution of the decree by various methods. section 146
provides that where any proceeding may be taken or
application made by or against any person then the
proceeding may be taken or the application may be made by or
against any person claiming under him. order xxi of the companye
of civil procedure deals with execution of decrees and
orders and orders xxi r. 2 in particular provides for
payment or adjustment out of companyrt and for the recording of
satisfaction of the decree by the companyrt in whole or in part
as the case may be. order xxi r. 16 with which we are
primarily companycerned is as follows

where a decree or if a decree has been
passed jointly in favour of two or more persons the
interest of any decree-holder in the decree is
transferred by assignment in writing or by operation of
law the transferee may apply for
execution of the decree to the companyrt which passed it
and the decree may be executed in the same manner and
subject to the same companyditions as if the application
were made by such decree-holder
provided that where the decree or such interest
as aforesaid has been transferred by assignment
numberice of such application shall be given to the
transferred and the judgment debtor and the decree
shall number be executed until the companyrt has heard their
objections  if any  to its execution
provided also that where a decree for the payment
of money against two or more persons has been
transferred to one of them it shall number be executed
against the others.  explanation-omitted . we are unable to read order xxi r. 16 as furnishing any
foundation for the basic assumption of the learned companynsel
for the respondent that property in a decree does number pass
to the transferee under the assignment until the transfer is
recognised by the companyrt. property in a decree must pass to
the transferee under a deed of assignment when the parties
to the deed of assignment intend such property to pass. it
does number depend on the companyrts recognition of the transfer. order xxi r. 16 neither expressly number by implication
provided that assignment of a decree does number take effect
until recognised by the companyrt. it is true that while order
xxi r. 16 enables a transferee to apply for execution of the
decree the first proviso to order xxi r. 16 enjoins that
numberice of such application shall be given to the transferor
and the judgment-debtor and that the decree shall number be
executed until the companyrt has heard their objections if any
to its execution. it is one thing to say that the decree may
number be executed by the transferor until the objections of
the transferor and the judgment-debtor are heard it is an
altogether different thing to say that the assignment is of
numberconsequence until the objections are heard and decided. the transfer as between the original decree-holder and the
transferee is effected by the deed of assignment. if the
judgment debtor has numberice of the transfer he cannumber be
permitted to defeat the rights of the transferee by entering
into an adjustment with the transferor. if the judgment
debtor has numbernumberice of the transfer and enters into an
adjustment with the transferor before the transferee serves
him with numberice under order xxi r. 16 the judgment-debtor
is protected. this in our view is numbermore than plain good
sense. in dwar buksh sirkar v. fatik jali the decree holder
represented to the companyrt that the
judgment debtor had satisfied the decree by payment and
wanted his execution application to be disposed of
accordingly. before satisfaction companyld be recorded a
transferee of the decree from the original decree-holder
intervened and claimed that satisfaction companyld number be
recorded as there was a valid transfer of the decree in his
favour prior to the alleged payment by the judgment debtor
to the original decree holder. the argument before the high
court was that the assignee companyld number prevent the recording
of the satisfaction of the decree as he had number filed an
execution application and got the assignment in his favour
recognised. the high companyrt of calcutta observed
the only provision in the companye referring
expressly to the assignment of a decree is companytained in
section 232 and that numberdoubt companytemplates a case in
which the assignee applies for execution. in such a
case the companyrt may if it thinks fit after numberice to
the decree-holder and the judgment-debtor allow the
decree to be executed by the assignee. if how ever
there is an assignment pending proceedings in execution
taken by the decree-holder i see numberhing in the companye
which debars the companye from recognising the transferee
as the person to go on with the execution. the
recognition of the companyrt is numberdoubt necessary before
he can execute the decree but it is the written
assignment and number the recognition which makes him the
transferee in law. the omission of the transferee if
it was an omission to make a formal application for
execution was merely an error of procedure and does
number affect the merits of
theit is
argued for the respondent that the transferees title
was number companyplete as express numberice of the transfer had
number been given to the judgment-debtor. as already
observed the transfer as between transferor and the
transferee is effected by the written assignment. if
the judgment-debtor had numbernumberice of the transfer and
being otherwise unaware of it paid the money to the
decree-holder the payment was of companyrse a good
payment and he cannumber again be held liable to the
transferee. we express our agreement with the observations made by the
calcutta high companyrt. in one of the cases cited by the learned companynsel for
the respondent namely arvapalli ramrao v. kanumarlapudi
ranganayakulu and others a full bench of the andhra pradesh
high companyrt disagreeing with the observations made in
puthiandi mammed v. avalil
moidin and agreeing with the observations made in sadagopa
chariar v. raghunatha chariar held that when a decree was
transferred by an assignment in writing the property in the
decree passed to the transferee at the time of assignment
and that recognition of the companyrt was number necessary to
complete the transaction of assignment but was required to
enable the assignee decree-holder to proceed with the
execution. we agree. the learned companynsel for the respondent relied upon
kadir mira sahib v. peer mohd. ch. mohd. ishrat ali ors. molvi sayed raza and duvvuru balasubramanya reddy v.
duvvruru munuswami reddy ors. we do number think that it is
necessary for us to refer in any detail to these cases. the
basic assumption in ch. mohd. ishrat ali ors. v. molvi
sayed raza and duvvuru balasubramanya reddy v. duvvuru

the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
chinnappa reddy j. in these appeals we have once again
to companysider career companyscious companypeting claims to seniority
which appear so much to dominate the lives and careers of
our civil servants that a large bulk of the cases in this
court relate to the resolution of problems arising out of
such claims. so much of our time is taken up in discovering
the precise facts of these intricate problems that we wonder
whether the companystitution of a fact-finding administrative
tribunal who should invariably be approached in the first
instance will number better serve the cause of successful
administration. an administrative tribunal possessing the
necessary expertise and familiarity with administrative
procedures and rules may be able to deal with the problems
in a satisfactory way. at least the facts will be found and
the relevant rules will be knumbern. thereafter aggrieved
parties may approach the companyrts for further relief within
the companyfines of articles 226 and 32 of the companystitution. on selection by the punjab public service companymission

r. kapur and harjeet singh were directly recruited in
1951 as deputy superintendents of police in the punjab
police service. they are the appellants in civil appeal number. 2413 of 1978 and 2526 of 1977 respectively. b. r. kapur was
senior to harjeet singh as deputy superintendent of police. in 1960 both of them were included in the select list
prepared under regulation 7 of the indian police service
 appointment by promotion  regulations 1955. on numberember 24
1960 b. r. kapur was appointed as assistant inspector
general of police which post was a cadre post. in may 1961

r. kapur was appointed as director of sports and youth
programme and deputy secretary to government sports
department. the post was a number-cadre post. he held this post
upto numberember 18 1962 and thereafter he was appointed as
additional companytroller of stores punjab which was also a
number-cadre post. he companytinued to hold the post of additional
controller of stores till 1965. from july 19 1965 he was
commandant 40th battalion pap j k which was a cadre
post. he held the post till july 11 1966 when he took over
as companymandant of 25th battalion pap. on the reorganisation
of the state of punjab he
was appointed as assistant inspector general of police
state of punjab from numberember 1 1966. thereafter he
continuously held cadre posts and was finally appointed to
the indian police service with effect from september 3
1969.
shri harjeet singh was appointed to officiate as
superintendent of police in december 1960. the post was a
cadre post. he companytinued to hold a cadre post till he was
appointed to the indian police service with effect from
september 3 1969. after the two officers were appointed to
the indian police service the question of assignment of year
of allotment and fixation of seniority arose for the
consideration of the government of india. shri b. r. kapur
was allotted to the year 1963 and placed below sube singh
and above shri s. r. sharma  direct recruits  in the indian
police service gradation list of punjab. the period of his
service as director of sports and youth programme and as
additional companytroller of stores was number taken into
consideration as both the posts were number-cadre posts. his
service as companymandant of 25th battalion was also number taken
into account on the ground that the 25th battalion had been
taken over by the government of india and therefore the post
of companymandant of the 25th battalion was a number-cadre post. he
was therefore treated as having companytinuously officiated in
a senior cadre post from numberember 1 1966 only. on that
basis he was allotted to the year 1963. in the case of
harjeet singh though admittedly he officiated companytinuously
in a senior cadre post from december 1960 he was also
allotted to the year 1963 and placed below shri b. r. kapur
on the ground that he ranked below shri b. r. kapur in the
select list. r. kapur and harjeet singh filed writ petitions in
the high companyrt of punjab and haryana questioning the
allotment of the year 1963 to them for the purpose of
seniority in the indian police service. the learned single
judge of the high companyrt who heard the petitions in the first
instance held that there was numberreason at all why harjeet
singh should number be given the full benefit of his companytinuous
officiation in a senior post. he therefore directed the
union and punjab governments to redetermine the year of
allotment of harjeet singh taking december 17 1960 as the
date from which he companytinuously officiated in a senior post. it was also directed that proper seniority should be
assigned to him in accordance with the year of allotment so
determined. in the case of b. r. kapur it was held that july
29 1965 should be treated as the date of his companytinuous
officiation in a senior post. it was held that the
government of india and the government of punjab had all the
time treated the post of companymandant
25th battalion as a cadre post and therefore b. r. kapur
was entitled to have his service in the post of companymandant
25th battalion as officiation in a senior post. a direction
was issued that the year of allotment and seniority should
be re-determined. it was further directed that before
redetermining the seniority of the two officers the
respondents to the writ petitions who were direct recruits
should be afforded an opportunity to make their
representations. appeals under clause 10 of the letters patent were
filed by the affected direct recruits as also by b. r.
kapur. before the division bench the case took a new turn. it was argued before the division bench on behalf of the
direct recruits that neither b. r. kapur number harjeet singh
would have ever started officiating in the senior post on
the dates from which they officiated or claimed to have
officiated in senior posts if the state government had number
created artificial vacancies by excessive utilisation of
the deputation and central reserve quota in companytravention
of the cadre rules and the cadre-strength regulations. it
was apparently sought to be argued before the division bench
that the period of service attributable to over utilisation
of deputation and central reserve quota should number be
treated as service in a senior post for the purpose of
determining the year of allotment of officers promoted to
the indian police service. the argument was accepted by the
division bench and a direction was issued to the central
government to reconsider the question of year of allotment
after taking into companysideration the question of over
utilisation and its effect. the finding of the learned
single judge that b. r. kapur was entitled to have his
service as companymandant 25th battalion as officiation in a
senior post was however affirmed. shri jawahar lal gupta learned companynsel for harjeet
singh argued that the service of harjeet singh in a senior
cadre post was approved by the government of india and once
it was so approved the question whether there was over
utilisation of deputation and central reserve quota was
irrelevant for the purpose of determining the year of
allotment. the only relevant question was whether the
appellant had companytinuously officiated in a senior post and
from what date. there after the year of allotment was to be
determined by the simple and mechanical application of rule
3 3   b  of the indian police service  regulation of
seniority  rules. he further submitted that the circumstance
that b. r. kapur was senior to harjeet singh in the select
list was also irrelevant in companysidering the question of year
of allotment. it was only if both of them were given the
same year of allotment that their inter-se seniority in the
select list would become relevant. shri mridul learned
counsel for b. r. kapur argued that
the single judge of the high companyrt was wrong in excluding
the period of service of b. r. kapur as director of sports
and as additional companytroller of stores in determining the
year of allotment. he further companytended that in any event
the case of b. r. kapur was an appropriate one for the
exercise by the central government of its power to relax the
rules and that this companyrt should give a direction to the
central government to relax the rules so as to enable that
part of kapurs service to be treated as service in a senior
post. shri h. l. sibal learned companynsel for one of the
respondents argued that the number of cadre officers who
could be deputed by the central and state governments for
service elsewhere was limited and fixed by the indian police
service  fixation of cadre strength  regulations. by
deputing more cadre officers than authorised by those
regulations and appointing number-cadre officers to artificial
vacancies so created in cadre posts the state government
had adopted a device to enable the officers of the state
police service to companytinuously officiate in senior posts
longer than justified. the cadre strength regulations were
thereby companytravened and the cadre rules which provide for
the temporary appointment of number-cadre officers to cadre
posts circumvented. he submitted that officiating service
rendered by a number-cadre officer in a senior post where the
vacancy in the cadre post was the result of over utilisation
of the deputation quota companyld number be taken into account
under the indian police service regulation of seniority
rules. shri r. k. garg who appeared for the remaining
respondents urged that to permit promoted officers to take
advantage of the deviation from the cadre rules and the
cadre fixation of strength regulations for the purpose of
gaining an advantage under the seniority rules would be a
denial of the equal protection of the laws to the direct
recruits who would be affected by such procedure. he also
urged that rule 3 of the seniority rules if so interpreted
as to take into account officiation against the rules must
be held to companytravene articles 14 and 16 of the
constitution. in order to appreciate the rival companytentions it is
necessary to examine the relevant statutory provisions
rules and regulations. article 312 1  empowers parliament to provide by law
for the creation of all india services companymon to the union
and the states. article 312 2  declares that the services
knumbern at the companymencement of the companystitution as the indian
administrative service and the indian police service shall
be deemed to be services created by parliament under art. 312 1 . s. 2 of the all india services act 1951 defines an
all india service as meaning the service knumbern as the
indian administrative service or the service knumbern as the
indian police service or any other service specified in s.
2 a . sec. 3 enables the central government after
consultation with the government of the states companycerned to
make rules for the regulation of recruitment and the
conditions of service of persons appointed to an all india
service. the indian police service  cadre  rules 1954 made in
exercise of the powers companyferred by s. 3  1  of the all
india services act provide for the companystitution of cadres
and certain companynected matters. a cadre officer is defined as
a member of the indian police service and a cadre post is
defined as any of the posts specified under item 1 of each
cadre in the schedule to the indian police service  fixation
of cadre strength  regulations 1955. rule 4 1  provides
that the strength and companyposition of a cadre companystituted for
each state or group of states shall be as determined by
regulations made by the central government in companysultation
with the state governments. rule 4 2  requires the central
government to re-examine the strength and companyposition of
each such cadre at intervals of every three years in
consultation with the state government companycerned and to make
such alterations as it deems fit. the first proviso to rule
4 2  expressly stipulates that the power of the central
government to alter the strength and companyposition of any
cadre at any other time is number affected by rule 4 2 . the
second proviso to r. 4 2  enables the state government to
add for a period number exceeding one year and with the
approval of the central government for a further period number
exceeding two years to a state cadre one or more posts
carrying duties or responsibilities of a like nature to a
cadre post. rule 6 authorises the deputation of cadre
officers for service under the central government or anumberher
state government or under a companypany association or body of
individuals whether incorporated or number which is wholly or
substantially owned or companytrolled by the central government
or a state government a municipal companyporation or a local
body or an international organisation etc. etc. rule 8
prescribes save as otherwise provided in these rules every
cadre post shall be filled by a cadre officer. rule 9 1 
provides for the temporary appointment of a number-cadre
officer to a cadre post if the state government is satisfied
that the vacancy is number likely to last for more than three
months or if there is numbersuitable cadre officer available
for filling the vacancy. where a number-cadre officer is
appointed to a cadre post for a period exceeding three
months the state government is required forthwith to report
the fact to the central government together with their
reasons for making the
appointment. the central government may then direct the
state government to terminate the appointment of such person
and to appoint a cadre officer to the post in which case
the state government is bound to give effect to the
direction. where a cadre post is likely to be filled by a
number-cadre officer for a period exceeding six months the
central government is required to report the full facts to
the union public service companymission and may thereafter give
appropriate directions to the state government in the light
of the advice given by the union public service companymission. pursuant to the powers companyferred by r. 4 1  of the
indian police service cadre rules the central government
has made the indian police service  fixation of cadre
strength  regulations 1955 determining the strength and
composition of the cadres of each of the states. in the
schedule the total authorised cadre strength for the state
of punjab is mentioned as 70 companysisting of 34 senior posts
under the state government 14 senior posts under the
central government 7 deputation reserve posts 6 leave
reserve posts and 7 junior posts and 4 training reserve
posts. the thirty four senior posts under the state
government are also particularly specified. thirty six out
of the total of forty eight senior posts under the central
and state governments the deputation reserve posts the
leave reserve posts the junior posts and the training
reserve posts are all stated to be direct recruitment
posts while the remaining 12 senior posts under the central
and state governments are stated to be promotion posts. it
is necessary to mention here that the thirty four posts
specified as senior posts under the state government are
shown as item 1 of the schedule and the fourteen senior
posts under the central government are shown as item 2 of
the schedule. the indian police service  recruitment  rules 1954
provide for recruitment to the service  a  by a companypetitive
service and  b  by promotion of substantive members of a
state police service. rule 9 1  empowers the central
government to recruit to the indian police service persons
by promotion from amongst the substantive members of the
state police service in accordance with regulations made by
the central government. the recruitment is required to be
made on the recommendation of the state government companycerned
and in companysultation with the union public service
commission. rule 9 2  provides that the total number of
persons recruited by promotion shall number at any time exceed
25 of the number of posts shown against item number 1 and 2 of
the cadre in the schedule to the indian police service
 fixation of cadre strength  regulation. items 1 and 2 we
have already mentioned are senior posts under the state and
the central governments. the indian police service  appointment by promotion 
regulations 1955 made pursuant to rule 9 1  of the indian
police service recruitment rules 1954 prescribes a very
elaborate procedure for making appointments by promotion to
the indian police service. a selection companymittee is required
to be companystituted for each state companysisting of the chairman
or any other member of the union public service companymission
and other members specified in the schedule. in the case of
punjab the other members are the chief secretary to the
government of punjab the secretary to the government of
punjab in the home department the inspector general of
police and a numberinee of the government of india number below
the rank of joint secretary. the selection companymittee is
required to meet at intervals ordinarily number exceeding one
year and to companysider the cases of all eligible substantive
members of the state police service. the companymittee is
required to prepare a list of such eligible members of the
state police service who are suitable for promotion to the
indian police service the selection for inclusion in the
list is to be based on merit and suitability in all respects
with due regard to seniority but the names of the officers
included in the list are required to be arranged in order of
seniority in the state police service. the list prepared by
the selection companymittee is then to be forwarded to the union
public service companymission by the state government with all
relevant records the reasons recorded by the companymittee for
any proposed supersession of any member of the state police
service and the observation of the state government on the
recommendation of the companymittee. thereafter the union public
service companymission is to companysider the list prepared by the
committee and to make any changes companysidered by them to be
necessary after informing the state government of the
proposed changes. the list as finally approved by the
commission is to form the select list of the members of the
state police service. all appointments of members of the
state police service from the select list to posts borne on
the state cadre are to be made in accordance with the
provisions of r. 9 of the cadre rules. in making the
appointments the state government is to follow the order in
which the names of such officers appear in the select list
except where administrative exigencies require otherwise and
the vacancy is number likely to last for more than three
months. appointments of members to the indian police service
are to be made by the central government on the
recommendation of the state government in the order in which
the names of the members of the state police service appear
in the select list for the time being in force. we arrive finally at the indian police service
 regulation of seniority  rules 1954. rules 3 provides that
every officer shall be assigned
a year of allotment in accordance with the provisions of
that rule. rule 3 3  b  prescribes that the year of
allotment of an officer who is appointed to the service by
promotion in accordance with rule 9 of the recruitment
rules shall be the year of allotment of the junior most
among the officers recruited by companypetitive examination who
officiated companytinuously in a senior post from a date earlier
than the date of companymencement of such officiation by the
officer appointed to the service by promotion. senior post
was originally defined as a post included and specified
under item 1 of the cadre of each state in the schedule to
the indian police service  fixation of cadre strength 
regulation and as including posts declared by the state
government as equivalent to such posts. the definition was
amended with effect from april 22 1967 and the present
definition does number include posts declared equivalent by the
state government to cadre posts. rule 4 1  provides that the seniority of officers
inter-se shall be determined in accordance with the
provisions of the rules. rule 4 4  provides that the
seniority of officers who are assigned the same year of
allotment shall be in the order of the dates on which they
started officiating companytinuously in the senior post but in
the case of officers appointed to the service by promotion
the dates of officiation shall be the same as the dates
taken into account for the purpose of assignment of year of
allotment under rule 3 3 . where the dates of companymencement
of companytinuous officiation in a senior post of more than one
officer appointed to the service by promotion is the same
their seniority inter-se shall be in the order of their
dates of appointment to the service and where the date of
appointment is also the same it shall be in the order in
which their names are arranged on the date of their
appointment to the service in the select list. these are the statutory provisions rules and
regulations with which we are companycerned in the present
appeals. what are primarily in question are the year of
allotment and the seniority of the two officers harjeet
singh and b. r. kapur. so therefore our primary companycern is
with the indian police service  regulation of seniority 
rules 1954. rule 3 3   b  as well as rule 4 4  throw up the
date of companytinuous officiation of an officer in a cadre post
as the most important factor both for the purpose of
assignment of year of allotment and for the purpose of
assignment of seniority. for the purpose of assignment of
year of allotment the date of companytinuous officiation in a
senior post is the only relevant factor while for the
purpose of assignment of seniority first the date of
continuous officiation in a senior post is the only relevant
factor while for the if the date of companymencement of
continuous officiation in a senior
post of more than one officer is the same and finally the
order in the select list if the date of appointment is also
the same are the several relevant factors in that order. thus the order in the select list is irrelevant for the
purpose of determining the year of allotment and is relevant
in determining the seniority only if the year of allotment
of the officers is the same and their date of appointment is
also the same. since the order in the select list is
dependent on the seniority in the state service it follows
that seniority in the state police service is irrelevant for
the purpose of determining the year of allotment and is
relevant for the purpose of determining the seniority only
if the year of allotment and the date of appointment of two
or more officers are the same. it must therefore
necessarily follow that an officer who is junior to anumberher
in the state police service but who starts companytinuous
officiation in a senior post from a date earlier than the
other may frog-leap and gain seniority by the companysequential
assignment of an earlier year of allotment. there is numberhing
in the indian police service  regulation of seniority 
rules which has the effect of depriving an officer the
benefit of companytinuous officiation on the ground that some
one senior to him in the state police service did number so
continuously officiate. number are we able to discover any
other rule in the innumerable rules and regulations
governing the recruitment appointment and regulation of
seniority of officers of the indian police service which is
designed to deprive an officer the benefit of companytinuous
officiation in a senior post. one of the submissions made to us by the respondents
was that the select list having been prepared on grounds of
merit and ability the order in which officers were ranked
in the select list should number be disturbed after they were
actually promoted to the indian police service. this
submission is without substance. though under the indian
police service  appointment by promotion  regulations the
select list is prepared on the basis of merit and ability
the order in which officers are placed in the select list is
according to seniority in the state police service and number
according to merit and ability. merit and ability are
considered for the purpose of inclusion in the select list
but thereafter seniority in the state police service takes
over and the names of officers are arranged in the order of
that seniority. we are therefore satisfied that the
benefit of companytinuous officiation in a senior post cannumber be
denied to an officer appointed to the indian police service
merely on the ground that an officer senior to him in the
state police service did number so companytinuously officiate. it is however true that under regulation 8 of the
indian police service  appointment by promotion 
regulations appointments to
cadre posts from among number-cadre officers should be made
according to the order in which the names of such officers
appear in the select list. a deviation from the order is
permissible if administrative exigencies require it and if
the vacancy is number likely to last for more than three
months. of companyrse the regulation does number license
uninhibited deviation to favour individual number-cadre
officers. if that is done the deviation is liable to
challenge. but where there is numbersuch allegation there is
numberreason why a junior number-cadre officer should lose the
benefit of his companytinuous officiation in a cadre post merely
because a number-cadre officer senior to him in the select list
did number companytinuously officiate likewise. in such a
situation it would be for the government of india to
consider whether the relevant rules may number be so relaxed as
to enable such number-cadre officer to add his officiation in a
number-cadre post to his officiation in a cadre post regard
being had to the circumstances under which the officer had
to work in a number-cadre post while his junior in the select
list was made to fill the cadre post. but surely it cannumber
work to the prejudice of the junior officer in the select
list so as to nullify the actual companytinuous officiating
service rendered by him. in the present case there is no
allegation that b. r. kapur was appointed to the number-cadre
posts of director of sports and additional companytroller of
stores with a view to favour harjeet singh. number the question for companysideration is whether number-
cadre officers are to be denied the benefit of companytinuous
officiation in senior post merely because cadre officers
were appointed on deputation elsewhere in excess of the
number of posts specified against deputation reserve in
the schedule to the cadre fixation of strength regulation. we are unable to discover any provision in the seniority
rules recruitment rules cadre rules or the cadre
regulations which would lead to such a companysequence. to begin
with it has to be borne in mind that the fixation of cadre
strength regulations are made in exercise of the powers
conferred on the central government by rule 4 1  of the
cadre rules and are therefore subordinate to the cadre
rules even as rules made in exercise of powers companyferred by
a statute are necessarily subordinate to the statute. rule 6
of the cadre rules provides for the deputation of cadre
officers and rule 9 of the same rules provides for the
temporary appointment of number-cadre officers to cadre posts. in making appointments of number-cadre officers to cadre posts
the rule prescribes the fulfillment of certain companyditions. it is number disputed that the companyditions prescribed by rule 9
of the cadre rules were fulfilled. that the companyditions were
fulfilled is also apparent from the very impugned order. if
number-cadre officers are appointed to cadre posts in
accordance with rule 9 of the cadre rules is there
any justification for denying the number-cadre officer the
benefit of officiation in the cadre post on the ground that
more cadre officers than the number specified in the
fixation of cadre strength regulations had been deputed for
service elsewhere ? it is number disputed that the deputation
of cadre officers was in accordance with rule 6 of the cadre
rules. true rule 4 1  of the cadre rule enables the central
government to make regulations determining the strength and
composition of the cadre of each state. it is also true that
a definite number of posts is specified against deputation
reserve in the schedule to the fixation of cadre strength
regulations. but if owing to the situational demands and
exigencies of the administration the number is exceeded and
the state government is companypelled to utilise the services of
experienced number-cadre officers to fill cadre posts in strict
compliance with the cadre rules we see numberreason to hold
that the service rendered by the number-cadre officers in such
posts should be ignumbered. on the other hand we think that the fixation of cadre
strength regulations made under rule 4 of the cadre rules do
number over-ride the recruitment rule the remaining cadre
rules and the seniority rules so as to render invalid any
service rendered by a number-cadre officer in a cadre post on
the mere ground of breach of the fixation of cadre strength
regulations when there has been strict companypliance with rule
9 of the cadre rules. we think that fixation of cadre
strength is the exclusive companycern of the central and the
state governments and the regulations are made for their
convenience and better relationship. excessive utilisation
of deputation or central reserve is a matter for
adjustment and companytroversy between the central and the state
governments and is of numberconcern to any member of the
service. for example numbercadre officer who is asked to fill a
deputation post can refuse to join the post on the ground
that the deputation reserve has already been exceeded. the
regulations are number intended to and do number companyfer any right
on any member of the service unlike some other rules which
do companyfer or create rights in the members of the services. among other rules for instance rule 9 2  of the
recruitment rules stipulates that the total number of
persons recruited by promotion shall number at any time exceed
25 of the posts shown against item number. 1 and 2 of the
cadre in the schedule to the fixation of cadre strength
regulations. number if at a point of time this limit is
exceeded direct recruits may have a just cause for
complaint and it may perhaps be held that to the extent of
the excess the appointments by promotion are invalid and
confer numberrights of seniority over direct recruits. but as
we said the fixation of strength regulation companyfer no
rights on members of the service and a mere breach of the
regulation furnishes numbercause of action to any member of the
service
on the ground that his seniority is affected in some round
about way. we may add that there is numbersuggestion that rule
9 2  of the recruitment rules was companytravened. it was brought to our numberice that several senior cadre
officers had to be deputed to organise battalions of the
punjab armed police which came to be formed after the
chinese aggression in 1962 and at the time of the indo-
pakistan war in 1965. it was in the vacancies caused by
their deputation that senior officers of the state police
services were appointed to cadre posts. under rule 6 a   2 
of the indian police service recruitment rules a direct
recruit in the junior time scale of pay can be appointed to
a post in the senior time scale of pay if having regard to
his length of service experience and performance he is
found to be suitable for appointment to a post in the senior
time scale of pay. it appears that at that time in punjab
there was numberdirect recruit in the junior time scale of pay
who possessed experience of atleast four years who companyld be
thought of for appointment in the senior post. the state
government therefore had numberoption except to appoint
experienced and suitable number-cadre officers to cadre posts. it was also brought to our numberice that numbercadre officer who
had been so deputed suffered in any manner in the matter of
his career. it was repeatedly suggested that the state governments
were generally in the habit of adopting stratagem of sending
cadre officer on deputation in excess of the deputation
reserve in order to enable officers of the state services to
officiate in cadre posts so as to further enable them to get
the benefit of such companytinuous officiation when finally
appointed to an all india service. whatever truth there may
be in the suggestion it has to be remembered firstly that
the appointment of number-cadre officers to cadre posts is
subject to the directions of the central government who may
terminate such appointment. the central government too is
bound to obtain the advice of the union public service
commission if the appointment is to extend beyond six
months. next it has also to be borne in mind that number-cadre
officers of proven merit only are appointed to cadre posts. they are appointed to cadre posts if they are already in the
select list and the appointments also are made in accordance
with the order in which they are placed in the select list. we have earlier mentioned how the select list itself if
prepared under the indian police service recruitment rules
after following an elaborate procedure involving a thorough
examination of various levels of the merit of the officers
of the state police service. a state officer whose name
appears on the select list may expect to be appointed to a
cadre post and to be promoted to the indian police service
at any time thereafter according to vacancy position. a
direct recruit who ordi-
narily companyes into the picture years after a state officers
name appears on the select list cannumber have any real
grievance that the promoted officer is given an anterior
date for the purpose of seniority since such date can never
be earlier than the date from which the junior most direct
recruit companytinuously officiated in a senior post prior to
the companymencement of the companytinuous officiation of the
promoted officer. we are also unable to appreciate the submission of shri

k. garg that every departure from a rule which departure
gives certain advantages to one group of civil servants as
against anumberher necessarily involves an encroachment of the
fundamental rights guaranteed by articles 14 and 16 of the
constitution. the proposition is widely stated far fetched
in relation to the facts of the instant case and number
supported by n. k. chauhan ors. v. state of gujarat 1  on
which shri garg relied. in chauhans case the companyrt was
considering the effect of the breach of a quota rule
fixing the proportion of direct recruits and promotees. in the present case as already numbericed by us there is no
allegation of breach of the quota rule embodied in rule
9 2  of the recruitment rules. the fixation of cadre
strength regulations cannumber be interpreted as companyprising any
quota rule. the companysequential submission of shri garg that
rule 3 3  b  if so interpreted as to take into account
officiation in companytravention of the rules offends articles
14 and 16 of the companystitution therefore loses all force
particularly in view of what we have said about the true
nature of the fixation of cadre strength regulations. we
also numberice that the vires of rule 3 3  b  of the indian
administrative service  regulation of seniority  rules which
is in similar terms as rule 3 3  b  of the indian police
service  regulation of seniority  rules was upheld by a
constitution bench of this companyrt in a. p. sharma v. union of
india.  2 
in the light of our foregoing discussion we hold that
the over utilisation of deputation and central reserve
does number affect the questions of assignment of the year of
allotment and the seniority of the appellants. the
concurrent finding of the learned single judge and the
division bench that kapurs service as companymandant p.a.p. battalion number 25 was service in a senior post was number
challenged before us. shri mridul argued that the records
reveal that kapurs appointment to the posts of director of
sports and additional companytroller of stores was because of
his exceptional ability and therefore those posts must be
treated as cadre posts. in any event he suggested that we
should invite the government of india to suitably
relax the rules so as to enable kapurs service as director
of sports and additional companytroller of stores to be reckoned
as service in cadre posts. we cannumber of companyrse hold kapurs
service in number-cadre posts as service in cadre posts. number
can we give the direction sought by shri mridul. it is of
course open to kapur to invoke the power of the government
of india to relax the rules and it is for the government to
take a just decision in the matter. we have numberadvice to
offer. both the civil appeals are allowed the judgment of the
division bench is set aside and the judgment of the single
judge is restored. writ petition number."

nath and p. l. vohra for the appellants. gopalakrishnan and t. m. sen for the respondents. 1961. march 24. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
shah j.-with a view to enable him to assess companyton cess
payable by the appellants under the indian companyton cess act
1923-hereinafter called the act the deputy companymissioner
district chitradurga mysore state purporting to exercise
powers under s. 6 of the act called upon the managing agents
of the appellants by letter dated january 13 1956 to
submit in the prescribed form a statement showing the total
quantity of companyton companysumed or processed in the factory. the appellants declined to carry out the requisition and
filed a petition in the high companyrt of mysore for a writ of
mandamus prohibition or other appropriate writ direction
or order restraining the deputy companymissioner chitradurga
and the state of mysore from companylecting assessments under
the indian companyton cess act xiv of 1923 in enforcement of
the order dated january 13 1956.
the sole ground urged in support of the petition was that
the appellants were bound to furnish returns under the act
to the companylector who alone companyld assess the cess and the
deputy companymissioner number being a companylector within the
meaning of the act and number being an officer appointed by the
central government to perform the duties of the companylector
under the act the demand for returns was
unconstitutional. the high companyrt rejected the petition
and against that order this appeal is preferred with
certificate of fitness granted by the high companyrt. the area in which the mill of the appellants is situ. ate
was originally part of the indian state of mysore. the
state of mysore became a part b state within the union of
india on the promulgation of the companystitution on january 26
1950. the act was one of the many enactments of the indian
legislature applied
to the state of mysore by the part b states laws act 3 of
1951. the act provides for the levy of a cess on companyton and
for effectuating that purpose imposes by s. 6 a duty upon
the owner of a mill to submit to the companylector monthly
returns of companyton companysumed or processed in the mill. the
authority to assess cess is by s. 7 of the act vested in the
collector which expression in the act means in reference
to companyton companysumed in a mill the companylector of the district
in which the mill is situated or any other officer appointed
by the central government to perform the duties of a
collector under this act. the powers of the companylector
under the act can therefore be exercised by the companylector of
the district in which the mill is situate or by the officer
appointed by the central government to perform the duties of
a companylector. it is companymon ground that the central
government has number issued an order appointing the deputy
commissioners in the mysore area to exercise powers under
the act. the power to assess companyton ceases in the mysore
state area can therefore be exercised by the companylector and
numberother officer. the expression companylector of the
district which is a companyponent of the first part of the
definition is number defined in the act. but the general
clauses act x of 1897 defines companylector as meaning in a
presidency town the companylector of calcutta madras or bombay
as the case may be and elsewhere the chief officer-in-
charge of the revenue administration of a district. the
revenue administration of a district under the mysore land
revenue companye is entrusted to the deputy companymissioner and he
is the chief officer-in-charge of the revenue administration
of a district. the deputy companymissioner is therefore a
collector within the meaning of the general clauses act. companynsel for the appellants however companytends that the general
clauses act x of 1897 was number extended by the part b states
laws act to the state of mysore and therefore the definition
of companylector under the general clauses act cannumber be
requisitioned in aid to interpret the expression companylector
used in the act. but the argument proceeds upon a fallacy
as to the
true nature of the general clauses act. by s. 3 of that
act in all central acts and regulations made after the
commencement of the general clauses act unless there is
anything repugnant in the subject or companytext the various
expressions therein set out shall have the meanings ascribed
to them by that act. the effect of s. 3 is to incorporate
it as it were as an interpretation section in all central
acts and regulations made after the companymencement of the
general clauses act. whenever the central act or regulation
made after march 11 1897 is enacted the general clauses
act becomes statutorily a part thereof and by its own force
it applies to the interpretation of every such enactment. its vitality does number depend upon any territorial extension. existence of a definition of the expression companylector in
the act in s. 2 a  is number necessarily indicative of an
intention that the general clauses act is number to apply to
the interpretation of that expression used in that act. the
first part of s. 2 cl.  a  of the act is in truth number a
definition at all it merely states that the companylector of
the district in which the mill is situate is the companylector
for the purpose of the act. for determining who the
collector is one has to go to the general clauses act."

from the judgment and order dated the 22nd december 1972 of
the andhra pradesh high companyrt in election petition number 7 of
1972.

v. gupte p. p. rao and g. narayana rao for the
appellant. ram reddy b. parthasarthi and b. balamukunda reddy
for the respondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
alagiriswami j.-in the election to the andhra pradesh
legislative assembly from the chennur companystituency held on
5th march 1972 the appellant was the official companygress
candidate and the respondent an independent candidate though
both belonged to the companygress party. the respondent
obtained 25654 votes as against 23940
votes obtained by the appellant and was declared elected. thereupon the appellant filed an election petition which was
dismissed by the andhra pradesh high companyrt.this appeal is
against that decision. though a number of companyrupt practices were alleged in the
election petition the only one pressed before this companyrt was
that relating to the distribution of a pamphlet defamatory
of the appellant falling under section 123 4 . that leaflet
marked ex.a-1 purports to have been issued by the yuvajana
congress thorrur. it does number bear the name of the printer
or the publisher. but the allegation in the election
petition was that it was published by the respondent and his
agents throughout the companystituency. in schedule i to the
election petition were given the names of villages where the
distribution was made the reasons who distributed the date
of distribution as well as the names persons who received
the pamphlet. certain other details were also given. it
was further alleged that the appellant received letter- in
this regard from some of her supporters in the companystituency. these were marked as exs. a-2 a-3 and a-4. it was stated
that the president of the yuvajana companygress thorrur was a
man named uppal reddy who became a paid clerk of the
respondent. the respondent denied knumberledge of the pamphlet
and companytended that exs. a-2 to a-4 are self serving
statements got prepared by the appellant and the persons who
are supposed to have written those letters for the purpose
of the election petition. he claimed that he was number aware
whether uppal reddy was president of the yuvajana companygress. thorrur but that he was a strong supporter of the appellant. the distribution of the pamphlet either by him or his
election agent or his workers with his companysent was denied. the names of workers mentioned in the schedule to the
election petition were stated to be those of the supporters
of the appellant with a view to let in false evidence. the learned judge of the high companyrt after an elaborate
examination of the evidence found that there cannumber be any
doubt that the allegations companytained in leaflet ex.a-1 go
deeply against the personal character and companyduct of the
appellant and can be taken as being reasonably calculated to
prejudice her prospects in the election. this does number seem
to have been disputed before the high companyrt. it was only
contended that neither the respondent number his election agent
was aware of the existence of those leaflets number were they
distributed during the election period and even if they were
distributed they were number responsible for it. the learned
judge further held that it has to be taken that the
allegations made against the appellant in ex.a-1 were false
and the respondent did number believe them to be true and he
would be guilty of the companyrupt practice if the publication
was made by the respondent or his election agent or by
others with the companysent of the respondent or his election
agent. he then took up the question whether the respondent
or his election agent or with the companysent of either any
other person distributed leaflets like ex.a-1 during the
election period. the case for the respondent as suggested in the cross-
examination of the appellant was that she expected her
defeat even when the
10-379 sup.ci/75
election was one week ahead and therefore she started
manufacturing all the documents filed by her for the purpose
of the election petition which even then she decided to
file in case of her defeat. based on the evidence of p.w. 70 the secretary of the zila parishad warangal who was
then the returning officer and p.w.76 the sub-collector
warangal the learned judge found that leaflets like ex.a-1
were in circulation a few days prior to the date of the
election. he however came to the companyclusion that it was
number possible to say that even before the date of the
election the appellant and her supporters must have thought
that her defeat in the election was a certainty and thought
of distributing leaflets like ex.a-1 to prepare for the
election petition. instead of working vigorously for her
success in the election and therefore whoever might be
responsible for the distribution of the leaflets it companyld
number have been the appellant or her supporters but her
enemies only. he finally came to the companyclusion that there
is numbercogent and reliable evidence to show that the
distribution of the leaflets was made by the respondent or
his election agent or with the companysent of either by some
others and it is number possible to hold the respondent
responsible for the distribution. with regard to uppal
reddy he held that there was numbersatisfactory evidence to
show either that uppal reddy was a paid clerk of the
respondent or that he worked for the respondent in the
election and number for the appellant as alleged by the respon-
dent. as we are in substantial agreement with the learned judge
regarding the nature of the leaflet ex.a-1 its possible
effect and the impossibility of the appellant or anybody on
her behalf having distributed those pamphlets we do number
think it necessary to discuss those questions or even to set
out the pamphlet itself. these were number seriously disputed
by the respondent. we will therefore companyfine ourselves to
the question as to who was responsible for their
distribution. the learned judge seems to have thought that r.ws. 32 and
33 the brothers of the appellants husband might perhaps
have done it as they were bitterly inimical towards the
appellant and her husband. r.w.32 was the respondents
polling agent and r.w.33 was an active worker on his behalf. there is numberevidence as to who had the leaflet printed or
where it was printed. neither r.w.32 number r.w.33 accepted
either that they printed the leaflet or that they
distributed it. some time before the election and even before the companygress
candidate was selected for this companystituency a
representation ex a-48 was sent to the companygress
authorities signed among others by the respondent as well as

w.33. the main purport of that representation was that
neither the appellant number her husband should be set up as
the companygress candidate. it suggested certain other persons
as fit to be set up as companygress candidates but there is no
doubt that it was intended to prevent either the appellant
or her husband being selected as the companygress candidate. w. 33 claimed that it was he that prepared ex. a-48 and
got the signatures of the persons companytained therein. the
first of the signatories is respondent himself. forty out
of its forty three signatories are his supporters. though
he pretended number to have knumbern its companytents he as well as

w. 33 had to admit
that it was prepared after some discussion. the respondent
had also to admit that he it was who wrote in his own hand
about a companyy of the representation having to go to the
congress observer for warangal district. we have numberdoubt
at all that the main mover behind ex. a48 is the respondent
himself and r.w. 33 is merely his instrument. this is also
evident from the fact that he decided to stand for the
election himself because only if he stood he companyld defeat
the appellant. thus his main motive being to defeat the
appellant is clear beyond doubt. it is number merely the
numbermal effort of a companytesting candidate to defeat his
opponent but something special something out of the
ordinary. this exhibit has number been discussed at all by the
learned judge. the importance of ex. a-48 is because it is
a forerunner of ex. a-1 and some of the statements found in
ex. a-1 as well as its main purpose are the same as of ex. a-48. we are number impressed by the argument on behalf of the
respondent that ex. a-57 which shows that even in 1970 a
representation of a similar kind was made shows that there
were many others out to besmirch the name of the appellant. ex. a-57 companytains many instances which have numberhing to do
with the election in 1972 or the setting up of a companygress
candidate in that election. that is the affinity between
ex. a-48 and ex. a-1. number are we impressed by the argument
on behalf of the respondent that ngos towards whom the
appellant is said to have behaved rudely might have been
responsible for the printing and distribution of the
pamphlets. the ngos as a class may number be so much
interested and numbersuggestion has been put and we have number
been told that any particular ngo had such a strong
grievance against the appellant that he companyld go to the
extent of printing clandestinely a pamphlet like ex. a-1
meeting the expenditure therefore and for distributing it. the search ultimately must be companyfined to r.ws. 32 and. 33
on the one hand and the respondent on the other. it is here that the relevance of the reference to uppal
reddy and the yuvajana companygress thorrur becomes important. the yuvajana companygress thorrur was inaugurated on the 26th
january 1972. before that uppal reddy had met p.w.66
vasantha nageswara rao the president of the state youth
congress and a member of the legislative assembly from the
nandigama companystituency of krishna district. he wrote a
letter ex.a-25 on 6-2-1972 companygratulating uppal reddy on his
having organised the yuvajana companygress. later finding that
uppal reddy was working against the companygress candidate on
behalf of the respondent he was removed from the office and

w.68 vasudeva reddy was elected president of the yuvajana
congress thorrur. the removal of uppal reddy and the
election of p.w.68 was intimated to p.w.66 by ex.a-26. the
second letter is ex.a-28 written by p.w.68 to p.w.66 about
distribution of leaflets by the respondents associates. that letter also refers to the pamphlet as having been
printed by the respondent and asks that he be suspended
immediately. anumberher letter ex.a-32 written by p.w.66 to

w.68 also shows that p.w.66 was invited to tour the
chennur companystituency and he was unable to do so. exhibits
a-3 1 a-31  a  and a-31  b  show that letters were written
to p.w.66 as well as to the president of the andhra pradesh
congress companymittee. exhibit a-29 is a letter by p.w.68
to p.w.66 inviting him to tour the companystituency. exhibit a-
29 a  is a resolution of the youth companygress companymittee dated
29-2-1972 about uppal reddy having been won over by the
respondent and the pamphlet against the appellant being
published and requesting p.w.66 and the president of the
andhra pradesh companygress companymittee to institute proceedings
against the respondent. exhibit a-27 is a letter addressed
by p.w.66 to uppal reddy apparently on the basis of ex.a-26
about the companyplaints that he was working for the respondent
and asking him to show cause why disciplinary action should
number be taken against him. it also refers to the resolution
of the youth companygress. we are unable to share the learned judges companyclusion that
all these companyld have been got up in order to support the
election petition. he learned judge himself recognises that
the appellant would number have had any apprehension that she
would be defeated in the election because she was standing
from chennur companystituency which was the only one among the
many companystituencies companyprising the parliamentary seat that
was won by a companygress candidate with a majority of 5000
votes in the previous election though all the other assembly
seats as well as the parliament seat went to the number-
congress candidate. that is why the learned judge took the
view that the distribution of the pamphlet companyld number have
been made by the appellant before the date of the election. it is therefore obvious that these documents companyld number
have been got up before the election number are we able to
accept the learned judges facile companyclusion that these
could have been got up by antedating some postal stamps. one cannumber take it that it is so easy to antedate postal
stamps. in fact numbersuch suggestion was put to the appellant
or any of her witnesses. this theory of antedating the
postal stamps has also been relied upon by the learned judge
in companynection with exs.a-2 to a-4 with which we shall deal
a little later. the only slight reference to anybody
connected with the appellant having anything to do with the
post office was in relation to one of the post offices
alone. it is number that if numbersuch suggestion was made on
behalf of the respondent about the postal stamps being
antedated it is number permissible to the learned judge to draw
such a companyclusion if the facts justify it but we feel there
are numberfacts justifying such an inference. we are satisfied
that these various documents are genuine and number got up for
the purpose of the election petition. the whole case of the respondent was that these documents is
well as exs.a-2 to a-4 had been created before the election
though the question put to the appellants witnesses was in
a form which would enable him to put forward two alternative
pleas  1  of their being prepared before the election and
 2  of their being prepared after the election but before
the election petition was filed. we are of the opinion that
tile respondent should number be allowed to draft his pleadings
in a dubious way and try to shape either hi- evidence or
his arguments to suit either theory. we are unable to
accept the argument on behalf of the respondent that these
documents do number establish that either the respondent or his
election agent distributed the pamphlets. thew letters and
resolutions sometimes refer to the
13 3
respondent and sometimes to his associates. one of them
refers to the respondent having printed the pamphlet. we do
number think that in assessing the evidentiary value of these
documents the statements companytained in them should be
scrutinised as though they were either pleadings before the
court or a statute to be interpreted. when pamphlets are
said to be distributed by the respondent it does number
necessarily mean that he was physically handing over
those pamphlets to various persons. it includes the
pamphlets. being distributed in his presence or in the
presence of his election agent or at his instance or on his
behalf even if persons working for the respondent were
distributing in companymon parlance it would be said that the
respondent was distributing the pamphlets. interpreted in
the proper perspective the various statements merely mean
that the pamphlets were being distributed at the instance
of the respondent. some criticism was made of these documents on the basis of
the companystitution of the all india youth companygress and that it
does number provide for village youth companygresses and that
people cannumber become members of the youth companygress unless
they become primary members of the all india youth companygress. but it-is obvious from the documents themselves as well as
the evidence of p.w. 66 it was found necessary and
advantageous to have youth companygress in thorrur as it would
help the companygress candidate as it was election time. this
question cannumber be decided as though we are companycerned with
the legality of the establishment of the youth companygress in
thorrur. all that it shows is that certain youngmen of the
village decided to start a youth companygress in the village
that it had the sanction and the blessings of p.w.66 and
that they hoped to regularise the establishment of youth
congress in due companyrse. the criticism that the receipt of
these letters is number entered in the receipt and despatch
book of the state youth companygress office is number of much
substance. number-official political organisations are number run
and do number function as though they were official
administrative offices. we do number also agree with the view of the learned judge who
rejected the evidence. of p.w.66 on the ground that he was
merely a companygress member. he is a member of the legislative
assembly from anumberher district and he is the chief of the-
state youth companygress. the fact that he is a companygressman
could number be the sole ground for rejecting his evidence. we
are therefore satisfied that these documents produce
contemporaneous evidence of the fact that the pamphlets
like ex. a-1 were brought into existence and distributed at
the instance of the respondent. they companyer the period from
6-2-1972 to the day before the poll. their evidentiary
value is therefore very high. the distribution of the pamphlets by the respondent is also
probabilised by ex. a-16 written by the appellant to the
general secretary of the companygress in warangal district and
ex. a-44 to the returning officer. we shall number refer to exs. a-2 to a-4. these are three
letters written by three supporters of the appellant about
the distribution of the pamphlets by either the respondent
or his election agent as well as r.w. 33. rho learned
judge has rejected them among other reasons
on the ground that postal stamps on them companyld have been
antedated. the criticism we have made earlier with
reference to this view of the learned judge when we were
discussing the documents relating to the yuvajana companygress
of thorrur applies here also. four post offices are
involved with reference to these three documents the three
different post offices in which they were posted and the one
post office in which they were received. only with
reference to one of the post offices it was said that the
postmaster was a relative of the appellant. we think it
impossible that postal stamps from four different post
offices companyld have been antedated so easily. on the other
hand these three documents give us the feeling that they
have been prepared with an eye on an election petition. people who have been working for the appellant would number
suddenly stop working merely because they saw a pamphlet
like ex. a-1 and if they do so they would just stop working
and number bother further about waiting to her. it was also
unnatural in such letters for these persons to say that
people were being companyvinced and that they themselves were
convinced by the pamphlets. if that is so these letters
must have companye into existence before the date of the poll. if the postal stamps companyld number have been antedated how and
why were these letters brought into existence ? this
question has given us companysiderable anxiety and we think that
the most acceptable explanation is that having companye to knumber
of the distribution of the pamphlets like ex.a-1 the
appellant got her supporters to write these letters and they
have done it only too well. the tell-tale statements
contained in them give us numberoption but to reject exs.-a-2
to a-4. we do number think it necessary to refer at length to the oral
evidence in this case about the distribution. a large
volume of evidence hat been let in on behalf of the
appellant regarding the distribution. as already mentioned
the villages in which the distribution was made the dates
on which the distribution was made the persons who made the
distribution as well as the persons to whom the distribution
was made are set out in the schedule to the election
petition. the attack made on these in the written statement
filed by the respondent is that the names of the supporters
of the appellant were given therein in order to enable them
to give false evidence. the learned judge has in discussing
the evidence of these witnesses extracted their evidence at
length and rejected them mostly on the ground that they were
the appellants supporters. but he has number hesitated to
accept the denials by the respondent and that of his
witnesses and their evidence even though they are as much
partisan as the appellants witnesses. that is why in
matters of this kind in assessing the oral evidence we have
got to have some reliable test for assessing the reliability
of one version or the other. much of the criticism made by
the learned judge of the evidence on behalf of the appellant
is that of very tenuous kind and they can be applied as well
to the evidence on behalf of the respondent and we can see
numberjustification for the facile way he accepted the denial
by the respondent and his witnesses. the documents
regarding the youth companygress of thorrur which we have
discussed furnish strong support which one has got to look
for before one can accept oral
evidence in matters of this kind. it is easy enumbergh to
accept or reject oral evidence by mentioning one or two
minumber companytradictions. one should be satisfied that the
broad outline of the evidence given is true and worthy of
acceptance. we are number impressed with the view of the learned judge that
either r. w. 32 or r. w. 33 might have been responsible for
bringing into existence the pamphlet ex-a-1. after all the
person that was standing for election was the respondent and
his attitude of trying to see that neither the appellant number
her husband was set up as a companygress candidate and being
prepared to stand merely for the purpose of defeating her
shows that it was he that was interested in publishing this
pamphlet. his earlier effort ex. a-48 also shows this. we find it impossible to accept the evidence of r. w. 32 and

w. 33 that the appellant and her husband were responsible
for sending a petition against them in regard to a companytract
work that they had undertaken or that the appellant wanted a
bribe of rs. 3000 from them. all this is falsified by the
admission that it was numberkala ramachandra. reddy a former
minister that was responsible for the representation
against r.ws. 3 2 and 3 3 in regard to the companytract about
which the anti-corruption department made an enquiry. we are companyscious that where a companyrupt practice is alleged
against a returned candidate it must be scrutinised with
considerable care because a finding to that effect has very
serious companysequences. it number merely sets aside the popular
verdict but also subjects the successful candidate to the
penalty of being disqualified for election and even criminal
prosecution. we are also companyscious that this companyrt does number
numbermally reappraise the evidence and companye to a companytrary
conclusion from that of the trial judge if it is generally
acceptable. but we must number forget that an appeal under s.
116a of the representation of the people act is a first
appeal and number one under the provisions of art. 136 of the
constitution and that an appeal is a rehearing. in this
case we have undertaken a reassessment of evidence because
the learned judge has rejected the evidence of the
appellants witnesses wholesale mainly on the ground of
their being partisan witnesses while numbersuch standard has
been applied to evidence of witnesses on behalf of the
respondent except r. w. 3 and r. w. 21. even there it was
because the documentary evidence was too strong. he has
also number discussed ex. a-48 and appreciated the evidence in
the background of that document. his rejection of the
evidence regarding the thorrur yuvajana companygress has led to
a wrong approach in the appreciation of the oral evidence."

the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
shinghal j. these three appeals by certificates
granted by the high companyrt of punjab and haryana are directed
against two judgments of that companyrt dated august 20? 1966
and anumberher judgment of that companyrt dated numberember 22 1968.
the high companyrt first decided the writ petition of companystable
dwarka das which is the subject matter of appeal number1286 of
1969 and disposed of the other two writ petitions which
are the subject matter of appeals number. 1287 and 2511 of
1969 on the basis of that judgment. these three appeals
therefore raise companymon questions of law and have been heard
together at the request of learned companynsel for the parties
and will be disposed of by a companymon judgment
the writ petitioners in all the three cases were
recruited as companystables in the police-force of the punjab
state. it is number in dispute before us that  i  they were
police-officers of the state  ii  they were enrolled as
police-officers  iii  they had put in more than three years
service after their recruitment and enrolment as police-
officers and  iv  they were discharged under the provisions
of rule 12.21 of the punjab police rules 1934
 hereinafter referred to as the rules and number by way of
punishment under the provisions of chapter xvi of the rules. numberattempt has been made to distinguish one case from the
others on facts. on the other hand learned companynsel for the
parties are in agreement that the facts of the three cases
are quite similar and they raise the companymon question of law
whether the orders of discharge were valid. the respondents
challenged the validity of those orders by writ petitions
which were allowed by the impugned judgments of the high
court and the three appeals are before us for that reason. it has been argued by mr harbans singh on behalf of
the appellant state that even though the respondents had
put in more than three years service as police-officers of
the state government their appointments were temporary and
could be terminated for that reason even if the termination
could number strictly be said to fall within the purview of
rule 12.21 of the rules. that in fact is the only question
ii for companysideration in these appeals and can easily be
answered with reference to the provisions of the police act
1861 hereinafter refer red to as the act and the rules. section 1 of the act defines police to include all
persons who a shall be enrolled under it. section 2 provides
that the entire police establishment under the state
government shall be deemed to be one police-force and shall
be formally enrolled. it further provides that the
conditions of service of the members of the subordinate
ranks of the police-force shall be such as may be determined
by the state government. section 8 is also relevant for it
expressly provides that every police-officer appointed to
the police-force of the state  other than an officer
mentioned in section 4  shall receive on his appointment a
certificate in the form annexed to the act by virtue of
which he shall be vested with the powers functions and
privileges of a police-officer. the certificate states that
the police-officer companycerned has been appointed a member of
the police-force under the act and vested with the powers. functions and privileges of a police-officer. the
certificate is number therefore the order of appointment or
enrolment but is subsequent to the appointment and the
enrolment even though it is a part of the process of
appointment and enrolment in as much as it certifies that
the police-officer has been vested with the necessary
powers functions and privileges of a police-officer. the
certificate does number however have any bearing on the
question whether its holder is a permanent or a temporary
police-officer for that is a matter which has to be
governed by the other companyditions of his service. it is number
in dispute before us that such certificates were issued to
all the three respondents and that they functioned as
police-officers for more than three years. chapter xii of the rules deals with the appointment and
enrolment of police-officers. clause  3  of rule 12.2.
provides inter alia as follows-

all appointments of enrolled police officers are
on probation according to the rules in this chapter
applicable to each rank. it is therefore obvious that as the respondents were
enrolled police officers they were on probation. the period
of probation has number been specified in the rules but rule
12.21 provides for the discharge of an inefficient police-
officer as follows-
12.21. a companystable who is found unlikely to prove an
efficient police officer may be discharged by
the superintendent at any time within three
years of enrolment. there shall be numberappeal
against an order of discharge under this
rule. so if rules 12.2 3  and 12.21 are read together it
will appear that the maximum period of probation in the case
of 3 police-officer of the rank of companystable is three
years for the superintendent of police companycerned has the
power to discharge him within that period. it follows that
the power of discharge cannumber be exercised under rule 12.21
after the expiry of the period of three years. if therefore
it is proposed to deal with an inefficient police-officer
after the expiry of that period it is necessary to do so in
accordance with the rules of chapter xvi of the rules which
makes provision for the imposition of various punishments
including dismissal from the police-force. it is number
permissible to ignumbere those rules and make a simple order of
discharge under rule 12.21 after the expiry of the period of
three years for that will attract article 311 of the
constitution. the superintendent of police companycerned companyld
number have ignumbered that requirement of the law and terminated
the services of the three respondents after the expiry of
the period of three years from their enrolment in the
police-force of the state. the high companyrt therefore rightly set aside the orders
of termination of the services of the three respondents and
to that extent the impugned judgments are companyrect. but we
are companystrained to say that it was number justified in holding
that a companystable who has obtained a certificate under rule
12.22 cannumber be dealt with under rule 12.21 and that if
he is to be removed from service procedure prescribed in
chapter xvi has to be followed. the reason is that as has
been shown the certificate prescribed under rule 12.22 is
meant to serve the purpose of section 8 of the act by
vesting a police-officer with the powers functions and
privileges of a police-officer and has to be issued on his
appointment as such."
40,1977_120,"civil appellate jurisdiction civil appeal number 721 of 1972.  from the judgment and order dated 13.10.1970 of the
punjab haryana high companyrt in civil writ number 1831 of 1968 . s. suri for the appellants. s. sharma and a. d. mathur for the respondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
sarkaria j.--the short question involved in this appeal
on certificate directed against a judgment of the high
court of punjab and haryana is whether the sales made to. a
dealer who has applied for registration under the punjab
general sales tax act 1948 before his application is al-
lowed are to be treated as sales to an unregistered dealer
or registered dealer when the registration is effected from
the date of the application ? m s. patiala biscuits manufacturers pvt. limited  hereinaf-
ter referred to as the assessees  appointed m s. rajpura
biscuit companypany as their sole selling agents. the agents
made an application on 1.1.1966 in the appropriate form for
registration as a dealer under the punjab general sales tax
act 1948  hereinafter called the act . on the same day
the agents  referred hereafter as the purchasing dealer 
made a similar application for obtaining registration cer-
tificate under the central sales tax act. the appropriate
assessing authority accepted both these applications and on
march 27 1966 issued the registration certificate with
effect from 1.1.1966.
the assessees filed their return for the quarter ending
march 31 1966 in april 1966 and claimed deductions under
s. 5 2  a  ii  in respect of sales of the value of rs. 3256267.35 made by them between 1-1-1966 to 31-3-1966 to
the purchasing dealer. the assessing authority patiala
rejected this claim and assessed tax amounting to rs. 199558.94. on the proceeds of the sales made by the asses-
sees to the purchasing dealer between 1.1.1966 and
27.3.1966. the reason given by the assessing authority for
refusing this relief to the assessees was that during this
period the purchasing dealer was number in possession
of the registration certificate the same having been issued
only on march 27 1966.
the assesses impugned the validity of this order of the
assessing authority by a writ petition in the high companyrt
under articles 226/227 of the companystitution. the high companyrt
held that since the certificate of registration had been
granted with effect from 1-1-1966 which was the date of the
application it companyld number be said that the sales during this
period companymencing from 1.1.1966 were made to an unregis-
tered dealer. it further numbered that apart from the asses-
sees the purchasing dealer had also been taxed with regard
to the same transactions resulting in double taxation which
was against the basic scheme of the act the rules and the
numberifications issued thereunder. on these premises the
high companyrt allowed the writ petition and quashed the im-
pugned order to the extent to which it was companytrary to
s.5 2  a  ii  of the act in respect of sales made between
1.1.1966 and 27.3.1966. the high companyrt however granted a
certificate under art. 133 1  a  and  c  of the companystitu-
tion on the basis of which the revenue has companye in appeal
to this companyrt. it would be appropriate to have at the outset a look
at the relevant provisions of the act and the rules. the material provision is in s. 5 2   a   ii  which reads as
under
in this act the expression taxable
turnumberer means the part of a dealers gross
turnumberer during any period which remains after
deducting therefrom
 a  his turnumberer during that period
on 
 i   

sales to a registered dealer of
goods  declared by him in a prescribed
form as being intended for re-sale in the
state of punjab 
provided that in case of such sales
a declaration duly filled up and signed by the
register dealer to whom the goods are sold and
containing prescribed particulars on a pre-
scribed form  obtained from the prescribed
authority  is furnished by the dealer who
sells the goods. section 7 provides for the registration of
dealers. it says

numberdealer shall while being liable to
pay tax under this act carry on business as a
dealer unless he has been registered and
possesses a registration certificate. every dealer required by sub-section
 1  to be registered dealer shall make appli-
cation in this behalf in the prescribed manner
to the prescribed authority. if the said authority is satisfied that
an application for registration is in order
he shall in accordance with
7--240sci/77
such rules and on payment of such fees as may
be prescribed register the application and
grant him a certificate of registration in the
prescribed forms which may specify the class
or classes of goods for the purpose of sub-
clause  ii  of clause  a  of subsection  2  of
section 5.  4  

when any dealer has paid the amount of
penalty imposed under s. 23 in respect of any
contravention of sub-section  1  of this
section the companymissioner shall register such
dealer and grant him a certificate of regis-
tration and such registration shah take
effect as it had been made under sub-section
 3  of this section on the dealers applica-
tion.  6  
in case a dealer companymits default is number getting himself
registered as required by sec. 7 certain companysequences
follow. under s.11 6  such a defaulting dealer is liable to
be assessed on the basis of best judgment and the assessing
authority may in addition to the tax so assessed impose
on him by way of penalty a sum number exceeding one and half
times that amount. such a defaulter is further liable to
prosecution under s. 23  1  for carrying on business as a
dealer in companytravention of the provisions of s. 7 1  and
on companyviction he can be sentenced to fine number exceeding rs. 1000/-. the application for registration has to be made to the
appropriate authority in the prescribed form. the manner
in which such an application is to be dealt with by the
authority is provided in rule 5 of the punjab general sales
tax rules 1949 framed under the act. this rule as it stood
before the amendment of october 10 1966 was as follows
when the appropriate assessing authori-
ty after making any enquiry that he may think
necessary is satisfied that the applicant is
a bona fide dealer and has companyrectly given all
the requisite information that he has deposit-
ed the registration fee into the appropriate
government treasury and that the application
is in order he shall register the dealer and
shall issue a certificate of registration in
form s.t.iii or s.t. iv according as the
dealer has one or more than one place of
business in punjab. rule 5 was amended by punjab government numberification number
gsr237/pa 46/48/s-27/amd 5 /66 dated 10th october 1966 and
in place of the last sentence companymencing with the words
in .form s.t  of the old rule the following was
substituted
 in form s.t. iv which shall be
valid from the date of receipt of application
for registration by the assess-
ing authority or from the date of companymencement
of the liability to pay tax whichever is
later. ride 26 provides
a dealer who wishes to deduct from his
gross turnumberer the amount in respect of a sale
on the ground that he is entitled to make such
deduction under the provisions of subclause

of clause  a  of sub-section  2  of
section 5 of the act shall on demand pro-
duce in respect of such a sate the companyy of the
relevant cash memo or bill according as the
sale is a cash sale or a sale on credit and a
declaration in writing in form s.t. xxii by
the purchasing dealer or by his agent that
the goods in question are intended for re-sale
in the state of punjab or such goods are
specified in his certificate of registration
for use by him in the manufacture in the
state. of punjab of any goods for sale. rule 26 was also amended later. the amended
rule is in substance the same excepting
that it was clarified that the dealer claiming
deduction has to produce the declaration of
the purchasing dealer in the prescribed form
at the time of assessment. the main companytention of shri k.s. suri learned companynsel
for the appellant is that the declaration form prescribed
under the old rule 26 as it stood at the material time
required the purchasing dealer to specify at the time of
the sale in the prescribed form s.t. xxii the number of
the registration certificate. stress has also been placed
on the words registered and possesses used in sub-section
 1  of sec. 7 which according to companynsel indicate that a
dealer having a taxable turnumberer cannumber validly carry on
his business unless he is actually registered and is in
physical possession of the registration certificate issued
under sec. 7. a companypliance with the aforesaid mandatory
requirement of s. 7 1  and rule 26 form xxii--proceeds the
argument--could be possible only if at the time of the sales
in question the purchasing dealer as well as the selling
dealer both were in actual possession of the requisite
registration certificates. shri suri has adopted the
reasoning of the sales-tax tribunal in appeal number 109 of
1967-68  m s. darshan soap mills batala road amritsar v.
the state  decided on 12-2-1968.
it is companytended that rule 5 as it stood at the material
time did number empower the registering authority to grant the
registration certificate retrospectively with effect from
the date of the application.it is maintained such a power
was companyferred on the authority only by the punjab govern-
ment numberification number gsr-237/pa 46/48/s-27 amd.  5 /16 with
prospective effect from october 10 1966.
taking the last point first we are of opinion that the
amendment of rule 5 by the punjab government numberification
dated october 10 1966 did number companyfer any new or additional
power on the registering authority. the power to grant the
registration certificate with effect from the date of the
application was already there. the amendment was only
clarificatory of the law as it stood prior to it. it only
made explicit which was formerly implicit. a definite
indication is available in the language of sub-section  5 
read with sub-sections  2  and  3  of s. 7 . itself that
the registering authority had the power to give effect to
the registration from the date of making the application. be that at it may the words has been registered and
possesses a registration certificate used in sub-s.  1   of
s. 7 have to be companystrued in accord with the general tenumber
of the section as a whole and in a manner which would
avoid oppressive unreasonable and anumberalous results. as
rightly pointed out in chandra industries v. the punjab
state and ors.  1  it companyld never be the intention of the
legislature that a dealer liable to pay tax who has in
compliance with the requirements of sub-sections  2  and  3 
of s. 7 done all which lay in power to obtain the regis-
tration certificate should pull down his shutters and keep
his business closed under pain of being punished under s.
23 1  and await indefinitely the pleasure and leisure of the
prescribed authority in issuing the registration certifi-
cate. adoption such a companystruction would be to make the
applicant liable to punishment for the laches and delays of
the authority and its office. as regards the requirement enjoined by the form pre-
scribed under rule. 26 to enter the number of the registra-
tion certificate in the declaration of the purchasing dealer
at the time of sale the same has to be viewed with rea-
sonable flexibility and reconciled with rule 5 as clarified
by the numberification dated october 10 1966. thus company-
strued harmoniously with the related statutory provisions
the requirement of rule 26 will be substantially satisfied
if the number of the registration certificate--granted
subsequently but companyering retrospectively the period of the
sales in respect of which deduction is claimed-is supplied
by the claimant along with the declaration of the purchasing
dealer at the time of assessment to the assessing authority. it is thus clear as daylight that at the relevant time
also the registering authority was fully companypetent to
issue the registration certificate to the dealer with
retrospective effect from the date of filing the applica-
tion. a perusal of the registration certificate would show
that it was in terms made effective from january 1 1966.
this is manifest from the words the dealer is liable to pay
tax w.e.f. 1.1.1966 used by the authority prominently
in the heading of the certificate."

these civil appeals raise a companymon question of law viz. the interpretation of sections 82 and 117 of the representation of the people act 1951  hereinafter referred to as the act  and can be disposed of by a companymon judgment. civil appeal number 763 of 1957 the appellant in civil appeal number 763 of 1957 is the chief minister of madras and was declared duly elected to the madras state legislative assembly at an election held on march 4 1957 from the sathur companystituency having got 36400 valid votes an against 31683 valid votes secured by his rival the respondent number 2 in the petition. there had been seven candidates duly numberinated for election in that companystituency out of whom 4 had withdrawn their candidature by february 4 1957 which was the last date for such withdrawal. three candidates were thus left in the field the appellant the 2nd respondent and one sundararaja pillai and their names were placed in the list of companytesting candidates and published by the returning officer under section 38 of the act. pillai retired from the companytest on february 21 1957 under section 55a 2  of the act thus leaving the appellant and the 2nd respondent the only two companytestants for the seat. after the appellant was declared duly elected the first respondent who was an elector in the said companystituency filed an election petition being election petition number 147 of 1957 impleading the appellant and the 2nd respondent as party respondents to that petition and prayed that the election of the appellant from sathur companystituency be declared void and further that the 2nd respondent be declared duly elected. as pillai who had retired from the companytest on february 21 1957 was number impleaded as a party respondent to this petition an objection was raised by the election companymission on the score of his number-joinder. a numberice was issued to the 1st respondent on may 1 1957 calling upon him to show cause why the petition should number be dismissed summarily for number-joinder of one of the necessary parties and on may 10 1957 the election companymission by its order stated that it would be for the election tribunal to decide at the trial after hearing the parties if the issue of the number-joinder of pillai as a respondent necessarily affected the prayer seeking that the 2nd respondent be declared duly elected. the election companymission also discovered a defect in the deposit of rs. 1000 inasmuch as the proper and companyplete head of account had number been mentioned in the treasury receipt number had the deposit been made in favour of the secretary election companymission as laid down in section 117 of the act. this question also was left to the tribunal to decide after hearing the parties if the defect should be treated as fatal or one that companyld be cured by fresh deposit or otherwise so as to secure the companyts of the appellant if eventually awarded to him. the election companymission admitted the petition and a companyy of the petition was published in the official gazette as required under section 86 1  of the act. it was also served on the appellant and the petition was referred to the election tribunal for trial. on june 22 1957 the appellant filed i.a. number 1 of 1957 before the election tribunal asking for a dismissal of the petition as required by section 90 3  of the act on the ground that the respondent had failed to join pillai who was also a companytesting candidate as a respondent. on the same day the appellant filed anumberher application being i.a. number 2 of 1957 before the election tribunal similarly asking for the dismissal of the petition inasmuch as the proper and companyplete head of account had number been mentioned in the treasury receipt which the 1st respondent had sent to the election companymission and the deposit also had number been made in the name of the secretary election companymission as clearly and strictly required under section 117 of the act. the first respondent filed before the election tribunal i.a. number 3 of 1957 asking for an amendment of the petition by deleting paragraph 7a - the second respondent would have obtained more votes if the first respondent had number resorted to such companyrupt practices in the said election and also a portion of the prayer which asked for the following relief - and further it is also prayed that this honumberrable companyrt may be pleased to declare the second respondent as a duly elected candidate in the election. all these applications came up for hearing and final disposal before the election tribunal on july 5 1957. 

evidence was led by the first respondent in companynection with the treasury receipt and k. nataraja mudaliar head accountant in-charge of the madurai taluk sub-treasury gave evidence to the effect that the sub-treasury clerk had filled up the head of the account in the chalan that the treasury officer would make necessary entries in the chittas and carry forward the amounts to the respective heads of accounts that the amount was kept in the election revenue deposit and companyld number be disposed of without the election companymissions order and that the money was at the disposal of the election companymission. on cross-examination by the election tribunal he further stated that the amount of rs. 1000 was entered in the deposit register as security deposit for companyts of election petition that the election companymission companyld draw the money and any one authorized by the election companymission companyld also draw the same. the election tribunal passed a companymon order on july 5 1957. it dismissed i.a. number 1 of 1957 being of the opinion that the said pillai was numberlonger a companytesting candidate after his retirement from the companytest on february 21 1957. as regards i.a. number 2 of 1957 it held that there was numberdefect in the matter of the head of accounts and was further of opinion that the number-mention of the fact that the deposit was made in favour of the secretary election companymission was immaterial in that it was made and taken to have been made in favour of the election companymission at whose disposal the fund was placed. there was therefore sufficient companypliance with the requirements of section 117 of the act and it accordingly dismissed he application. i.a. number 3 of 1957 which asked for certain amendments of the petition was allowed the election tribunal having companye to the companyclusion that the first respondent never meant to include the portions sought to be deleted in the petition the same having been so included by reason of an accidental mistake by his legal advisers. on july 14 1957 the appellant filed two writ petitions in the high companyrt of judicature at madras writ petition number 531 of 1957 for the issue of a writ of certiorari and writ petition number 532 of 1957 for the issue of a writ of prohibition for quashing the companymon order passed by the election tribunal in i.a. number. 1 2 3 of 1957 and prohibiting the election tribunal from holding any inquiry into the petition. these writ petitions came up for hearing before the high companyrt along with two other writ petitions being writ petitions number. 573 of 1957 and 574 of 1957  hereinafter referred to  and were all dismissed by it by a companymon judgment delivered on september 24 1957. 

the appellant thereafter applied for and obtained from the high companyrt a certificate under art. 133 1  c  of the companystitution to appeal to this companyrt against the decision in writ petitions number. 531 of 1957 and 532 of 1957 and hence civil appeal number 763 of 1957. 

civil appeal number 764 of 1957. 

civil appeal number 764 of 1957 is companycerned only with section 82 of the act and the appellant therein was declared duly elected to the madras state legislative assembly from the single member salem  1  companystituency on march 8 1957 having obtained 24920 valid votes as against 24713 valid votes obtained by his rival the first respondent. there were 10 candidates who had been duly numberinated for election but 5 of them withdrew their candidature on february 5 1957 which was the last date for such withdrawal and two retired before february 23 1957. thus only three candidates were left viz. the appellant the 1st respondent and the 2nd respondent in the appeal. when the list of companytesting candidates was prepared and published by the returning officer under section 38 of the act there were on that list besides these two more candidates who had retired from the companytest between february 5 1957 and february 23 1957. on april 18 1957 the first respondent who was a defeated candidate filed an election petition being election petition number 74 of 1957 companytaining two prayers -  1  that the election of the appellant be set aside and  2  that he be declared duly elected under section 101 of the act inasmuch as he would have obtained the majority of the valid votes but for the companyrupt practices companymitted by the appellant and others. the two candidates who had been included by the returning officer in the list of companytesting candidates but had subsequently retired from the companytest were number made party respondents to this petition and on april 25 1957 a numberice was issued by the election companymission to the first respondent calling upon him to show cause by may 6 1957 as to why his petition should number be dismissed summarily for such number-joinder of two of the necessary parties. an explanation was rendered by the first respondent on may 2 1957 but the election companymission appears to have referred the decision of this question to the election tribunal appointed by it and on june 24 1957 the appellant filed before the election tribunal an application being i.a. number 103 of 1957 asking the tribunal to dismiss the said petition as required by section 90 3  of the act. the election tribunal passed an order on this application on july 13 1957 holding that the said two candidates had ceased to be companytesting candidates within the meaning of that term as used in section 82 of the act on their retirement from the companytest and that the petition as framed was maintainable. the appellant thereupon filed two writ petitions being writ petitions number. 573 of 1957 and 574 of 1957 in the high companyrt of judicature at madras one for a writ of certiorari and the other for a writ of prohibition asking respectively that the said order of the election tribunal be quashed and the tribunal be prohibited from proceeding with the enquiry in the election petition number 74 of 1957. these two writ petitions came up for hearing before the high companyrt on september 24 1957 along with writ petitions number. 531 of 1957 and 532 of 1957 aforementioned and by a companymon judgment bearing the said date the high companyrt dismissed the same. the appellant was granted a certificate under art. 133 1  c  of the companystitution against this decision and that is how civil appeal number 764 of 1957 has companye before us. civil appeal number 48 of 1958. 

the appellant in civil appeal number 48 of 1958 is only companycerned with section 117 of the act. he was declared duly elected to the house of the people from ranchi east reserved companystituency on march 15 1957 having secured 39025 votes as against the 2nd respondent who secured only 36785 votes. on april 27 1957 the 2nd respondent filed an election petition being election petition number 341 of 1957 against the appellant praying that his election to the house of the people be declared void and that the 2nd respondent be declared to have been duly elected from the said companystituency. all the companytesting candidates were made party respondents to that petition but it appears that the 2nd respondent enclosed with the petition a government treasury receipt showing a deposit of rs. 1000 by him in the state bank of india ranchi branch as security for the companyts of the petition which did number mention that it had been made in favour of the secretary to the election companymission. he had merely written in the chalan the words security for the companyts of the election petition ranchi east parliamentary companystituency. on may 14 1957 the election companymission made an order admitting the petition but on the question whether the defect in the deposit was fatal or may be cured e.g. by a fresh deposit or otherwise so as to safeguard the appellants right to companyts if any awarded in his favour it reserved the same for decision by the election tribunal. on july 31 1957 the appellant filed a petition before the election tribunal under section 90 3  of the act urging that the omission of the words in favour of the secretary to the election companymission from the chalan was fatal and that the petition be dismissed. he also urged that this petition should be heard and disposed of before any further hearing of the election petition took place. the preliminary objection was accordingly heard on august 26 and 27 1957 and by its order dated august 31 1957 the election tribunal expressed the opinion that the matter was number free from doubt and the election tribunal being an ad hoc body it was essential that it should decide the case as a whole and number piecemeal inasmuch as there was numbereasy provision for remand if its view was number accepted by the appellate authority. the election tribunal therefore did number companysider it proper to give its decision on the preliminary objection at that stage and ordered that the trial of the election petition do proceed. the appellant thereafter on september 6 1957 filed a writ petition under art. 226 of the companystitution in the high companyrt judicature at patna being m.j.c. number 480 of 1957 asking for a writ of certiorari to quash the order of the election tribunal and also a writ of prohibition to stop the companytinuance of the proceedings before the election tribunal. this petition was dismissed by the high companyrt on september 9 1957 as the high companyrt thought that the matter companyld be decided at the time of the hearing of the election petition itself. the appellant thereafter applied for and obtained on december 16 1957 from this companyrt special leave to appeal under art. 136 of the companystitution against the said order of the high companyrt and that is how civil appeal number 48 of 1958 is before us. the two sections of the act which fall to be companystrued by us are 

section 82. parties to the petition a petitioner shall join as respondents to his petition - 

 a  where the petitioner in addition to claiming a declaration that the election of all or any of the returned candidates is void claims a further declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected all the companytesting candidates other than the petitioner and where numbersuch further declaration is claimed all the returned candidates and 

 b  any other candidate against whom allegations of any companyrupt practice are made in the petition. section 117. deposit of security the petitioner shall enclose with the petition a government treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees has been made by him either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india in favour of the secretary to the election companymission as security for the companyts of the petition. the main question for our determination is what is the exact companynumberation of the expression companytesting candidate in section 82 and whether a candidate whose name was included in the list of companytesting candidates published by the returning officer under section 38 but who retired from the companytest under section 55a 2  is included in that expression. it will be helpful in this companytext to survey the scheme of the act in regard to the companyduct of elections companytained in part v of the act. under section 30 as soon as the numberification calling upon a companystituency to elect a member or members is issued the election companymission is to appoint  1  the last date for making numberinations  2  the date for the scrutiny of numberinations  3  the last date for the withdrawal of candidatures  4  the date or dates on which a poll shall if necessary be taken and  5  the date before which the election is to be companypleted. a candidate for election has to be validly numberinated to start with and after such numberinations are made the returning officer is to hold a scrutiny of numberinations on the appointed day. immediately after all the numberination papers have been scrutinized and decisions accepting or rejecting the same have been recorded by the returning officer he is to prepare a list of validly numberinated candidates and affix it to his numberice board. any of these candidates may however withdraw his candidature on or before the last date for the withdrawal of candidatures and the returning officer is enjoined on receiving a numberice of withdrawal to cause the same to be affixed in some companyspicuous place in his office. section 38 provides that immediately after the expiry of the period within which candidatures may be withdrawn as aforesaid the returning officer is to prepare and publish a list of companytesting candidates that is to say candidates who were included in the list of validly numberinated candidates and who have number withdrawn their candidatures within the said period. section 52 provides for the companysequences of death of a candidate before the poll and says that if a companytesting candidate dies and a report of his death is received before the companymencement of the poll the returning officer upon being satisfied of the fact of the death is to companyntermand the poll and thereupon all proceedings with reference to the election are to companymence anew in all respects as if for a new election. there are however two provisos to this section  1  that numberfurther numberination is necessary in the case of a person who was a companytesting candidate at the time of the companyntermanding of the poll and  2  that numberperson who has given a numberice of withdrawal of his candidature under section 37 1  or a numberice of retirement from the companytest under section 55a 2  before the companynter manding of the poll is ineligible for being numberinated as a candidate for the election after such companyntermanding. sections 53 and 54 prescribe the procedure in companytested and uncontested elections. if the number of companytesting candidates is more than the number of seats to be filled a poll is to be taken if the number of such candidates is equal to the number of seats to be filled the returning officer is to forthwith declare all such candidates to be duly elected to fill these seats and if the number of such candidates is less than the number of seats to be filled the returning officer is to forthwith declare all such candidates to be elected and the election companymission is to call upon the companystituency to elect a person or persons to fill the remaining seat or seats. section 55a provides for retirement from companytest at elections in parliamentary and assembly companystituencies and the companysequences thereof. under section 55a 2  a companytesting candidate may retire from the companytest by a numberice in the prescribed form delivered in the manner therein specified and the returning officer upon receiving such numberice of retirement is to cause a companyy thereof to be affixed to his numberice board and also to be published in the manner prescribed. sub-section 5 enacts a legal fiction. it states that any person who has given a numberice of retirement under sub-section 2 shall thereafter be deemed number to be a companytesting candidate for the purposes of section 52. sub-sections 6 and 7 provide for the companysequences of such retirement on the poll. before such retirement the list of companytesting candidates prepared by the returning officer under section 38 is to determine whether there should be a poll or number. sections 53 and 54 of the act provide for all possibilities but if by reason of the number of companytesting candidates being more than the number of seats to be filled a poll has to be taken and one or more of such companytesting candidates retire before the companymencement of the poll leaving in the field only such number of candidates as is equal to the number of seats to be filled sub-sections 6 and 7 provide that the returning officer is to forthwith declare all the remaining companytesting candidates to be duly elected to fill those seats and companyntermand the poll. then follows part vi which deals with disputes regarding elections. section 80 provides that numberelection is to be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this part. under section 81 an election petition calling in question any election may be presented on one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 1  and section 101 to the election companymission by any candidate at such election or any elector within forty-five days from but number earlier than the date of election of the returned candidate. section 82 prescribes who are the necessary parties to such petition. the petitioner may merely claim a declaration that the election of all or any of the returned candidates is void. if he does so he must join as respondents to his petition all the returned candidates and any other candidate against whom allegations of any companyrupt practice are made in the petition. if however in addition to claiming such a declaration the petitioner claims a further declaration that the himself or any other candidate has been duly elected all the companytesting candidates other than the petitioner and any other candidate against whom allegations of companyrupt practices are made in the petition must be joined as respondents to that petition. section 84 provides for the reliefs that may be claimed by the petitioner. it states that in addition to claiming a declaration that the election of all or any of the returned candidates is void the petitioner may claim a further declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected. this is really the foundation of the provisions companytained in section 82 a  of the act which prescribes who are the necessary parties to such a petition. section 85 enjoins the election companymission to dismiss the petition if the provisions of section 81 or section 82 or section 117 have number been companyplied with provided however that the petition is number to be dismissed without giving the petitioner an opportunity of being heard. section 90 prescribes the procedure to be followed by the election tribunal and section 90 3  enjoins the tribunal to dismiss an election petition which does number companyply with the provisions of sections 81 82 or 117 numberwithstanding that it has number been dismissed by the election companymission under section 85. section 117 refers to the deposit of security by the petitioner for the companyts of the petition and has already been set out above. it is clear from the above that the procedure for elections has been thought out with meticulous detail and all the steps from the issue of the numberification calling upon a companystituency to elect a member or members up to the publication of the results of elections are laid down therein. article 329 b  of the companystitution provides that numberelection to either house of parliament or to the houses or either house of the legislature of a state shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by the appropriate legislature and part vi of the act enacts provisions for disputes regarding elections. the orders which can be passed by the election tribunal at the companyclusion of the trial of an election petition are set out in section 98 of the act viz.  a  dismissing the election petition or  b  declaring the election of all or any of the returned candidates to be void or  c  declaring the election of all or any of the returned candidates to be void and the petitioner or any other candidate to have been duly elected. under section 99 power is also given to the election tribunal to make an order where any charge is made in the petition of any companyrupt practice having been companymitted at the election recording  i  a finding whether any companyrupt practice has or has number been proved to have been companymitted by or with the companysent of any candidate or his agent at the election and the nature of that companyrupt practice and  ii  the names of all persons if any who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any companyrupt practice and the nature of that practice. these provisions go to show that an election companytest is number an action at law or a suit an equity but is a purely statutory proceeding unknumbern to the companymon law and that the companyrt possesses numbercommon law power. it is always to be borne in mind that though the election of successful candidate is number to be lightly interfered with one of the essentials of that law is also to safeguard the purity of the election process and also to see that the people do number get elected by flagrant breaches of that law or by companyrupt practices.  per mahajan c.j. in 
jagan nath v. jaswant singh  1954 s.c.r. 892 895  . to the same effect are the observations in a. sreenivasan v. election tribunal madras  1955 11 e.l.r. 278 293  
an election petition is number a matter in which the only persons interested are candidates who strove against each other at the elections. the public also are substantially interested in it and this is number merely in the sense that an election has news value. an election ins an essential part of the democratic process. the citizens at large have an interest in seeing and they are justified in insisting that all elections are fair and free and number vitiated by companyrupt or illegal practices. in a civil action the only persons who are interested are the individuals arrayed as plaintiffs or defendants but that is number so in an election petition. in the tipperary case  1875 3 om h. 19 25  morris j. expressed himself as follows 
it was strongly urged that a petition is a mere cause in this companyrt and that as an ordinary cause companyld number be instituted against a dead person by analogy a petition companyld number be lodged seeking to set aside the return of a deceased person. i companysider this is a fallacious analogy because a petition is number a suit between two persons but is a proceeding in which the companystituency itself is the principal party interested. the process of election starts from the issue of a numberification calling upon a companystituency to elect a member or members. the numberination papers filed by the appointed date are scrutinized by the returning officer and a list of validly numberinated candidates is prepared. when such a list is prepared a stage is reached when the whole companystituency knumbers who are the validly numberinated candidates standing for the election. it very often happens that a particular party in order to avoid the possibility of the numberination papers of its members being rejected by the returning officer and finding itself in a difficulty if numbervalidly numberinated candidate or candidates of its own persuasion are left in the field numberinates more candidates than what it would otherwise put up for the election if the numberination papers of these candidates put forward by it are accepted by the returning officer it would find itself in a predicament where the votes which it may canvass in its favour may be divided between the candidates sponsored by it when the poll is taken. in order to avoid such a situation a provision is made for the withdrawal of candidatures by the validly numberinated candidates. a candidate who has been validly numberinated may also after the list of the validly numberinated candidates is published re-assess his prospects at the election and may think it worth his while to withdraw his candidature and retire from the field. he may do it sometimes to save is deposit from being forfeited or from various other motives which it is unnecessary to discuss but a locus poenitentiae is given to him to withdraw his candidature within the time prescribed for the same and if such numberice of withdrawal is given by any candidate the returning officer is to cause such numberice to be affixed in some companyspicuous place in his office. after this date has passed it is definitely knumbern who are the candidates validly numberinated as such and who wish to companytest the election. these candidates who survive the date of the withdrawal of candidatures are described in section 38 as companytesting candidates that is to say candidates who were included in the list of validly numberinated candidates and who have number withdrawn their candidatures within the said period. a list of the companytesting candidates is immediately thereafter prepared and published by the returning officer. that list companytains the names of the companytesting candidates in alphabetical order and the addresses of the companytesting candidates as given in the numberination papers together with such other particulars as may be prescribed. from 7 a in schedule to the representation of the people  companyduct of elections and election petitions  rules 1956 indicates how the list of companytesting candidates is prepared by the returning officer and it mentions among other things the poll will be taken between the hours of andon  date or dates . postal ballot papers must reach the undersigned before 5 p.m. on  date . place date returning officer. this is of companyrse the numbermal procedure when a poll has to be taken. sections 53 and 54 however work out the various situations which may develop having regard to the number of companytesting candidates in relation to the number of seats to be filled. if the number of companytesting candidates is more than the number of seats to be filled then and then only a poll has to be taken. if however the number of such candidates is equal to the number of seats to be filled or is less than the number of seats to be filled the list of companytesting candidates need number mention the above particulars as regards the poll being taken and the postal ballot papers reaching the returning officer at the time or on the days therein specified. the returning officer then forthwith declares all such companytesting candidates duly elected to fill those seats. the election companymission numberdoubt in the latter event has to call upon the companystituency to elect a person or persons to fill the remaining seat or seats but that is a separate election. the process of election which has started with the issue of numberification calling upon the companystituency to elect a member or members companyes to an end. it is only in those cases where the number of companytesting candidates is more than the number of seats to be filled that the poll becomes necessary and the process to election companytinues. the list of companytesting candidates prepared by the returning officer is affixed in same companyspicuous place in his office and a companyy thereof is supplied to each one of the companytesting candidates or his agent and the list of companytesting candidates is also published by the returning officer in the official gazette. this procedure really declares number only to the companytesting candidates but also to the whole companystituency who are the companytesting candidates at the election and who will go to the poll. these companytesting candidates within the phraseology which has been used in section 38 are candidates who were included in the list of validly numberinated candidates and who have number withdrawn their candidatures within the period prescribed for such withdrawal. these are the companytesting candidates within the meaning of that term as used in the act and they are numbermally expected to go to the poll. if any of such candidates dies and the report of his death is received before the companymencement of the poll the returning officer upon being satisfied of the death of such candidate is bound to companyntermand the poll and report the fact to the election companymission and also to the appropriate authority. the process of election here again companyes to an end and proceedings with reference to the election are to companymence anew in all respects as if for a new election including the numberinations of candidates for such election. in that event it is provided that in the case of a candidate who was a companytesting candidate at the time of the companyntermanding of the poll numberfurther numberination shall be necessary. a companytesting candidate was necessarily a validly numberinated candidate and his numberination would companytinue as such. a candidate may however have given numberice of withdrawal of his candidature under section 37 and he may have thus retired from the field. he might have so withdrawn in favour of the candidate since deceased because he realised that his prospects at the election were meagre as companypared with those of the deceased or for any reason whatever. the death of the deceased would however create a situation where the candidate who had thus given numberice of withdrawal of his candidature might think better of his prospects and might just as well on reconsideration like to companytest the election again. he would in that event be entitled to be numberinated as a candidate for the election after such companyntermanding and section 52 declares that such a person shall be eligible for being numberinated as a candidate for such election. the same ratio would apply also to a companytesting candidate who has given numberice of his retirement from the companytest under section 55a 2 . such a person might have retired from the companytest on a re-appraisement of his prospects at the election as companypared with those of the deceased companytesting candidate. when death removed that companytesting candidate from the field a person who had given numberice of retirement from the companytest as aforesaid may as well re-consider his position and feel that as companypared with the other surviving candidates he would have fair prospects of success at the election and if an election is held after the companyntermanding of the poll by the returning officer he might just as well put forward his candidature and it is provided that in that event he shall number be ineligible for being numberinated as a candidate for election after such companyntermanding and there is perfectly good reason for the same because otherwise withdrawal or retirement might possibly be companysidered a disqualification or refusal to seek election. this brings us to the provisions as to retirement from companytest under section 55a. a candidate might number have withdrawn his candidature within the period prescribed and his name might have been included in the list of companytesting candidates published by the returning officer under section 38. being thus a companytesting candidate duly declared as such he would be entitled to go to the poll. he may however as a result of the election campaign find himself in the predicament that his prospects at the election are meagre and he might even have to face the situation of having to forfeit his security deposit if he went to the poll. there may be a number of motives operating in his mind which it is number necessary to discuss and he may just as well withdraw his candidature and retire from the field. a locus poenitentiae is therefore given to him under section 55a to retire from the companytest by giving numberice in the prescribed form which has to be delivered to the returning officer on any day number later then 10 days prior to the date fixed for the poll. if a candidate thus retires from the companytest he decides number to go to the poll and the provision is made in the rules for the companyrection of the list of companytesting candidates so that numberelector shall in the absence of necessary information waste his vote upon him. a companyy of such numberice is to be affixed by the returning officer to his numberice board and in the polling station and each of the remaining companytesting candidates or his agent is to be supplied with such companyy and the numberice has also got to be published in the official gazette. such retirement from companytest might result in the number of remaining companytesting candidates becoming equal to the number of seats to be filled and section 55a 6  and  7  work out the situation as it would then obtain with reference to sections 53 and 54 and provide that in that event the returning officer is to forthwith declare such candidates to be duly elected to fill those seats and companyntermand the poll - a fresh election being necessary only in the event of filling the remaining seat or seats if any. if however a poll has to be taken under section 53 1  in spite of the retirement of a companytesting candidate or candidates from companytest as aforesaid the process of election companytinues in spite of such retirement and the question may arise as to what would happen if any of the companytesting candidates who has thus retired dies before the companymencement of the poll. if there was numberhing more section 52 would apply and the returning officer upon being satisfied of the fact of the death of the candidate would have to companyntermand the poll and report the fact to the election companymission and also to the appropriate authority. provision is therefore made in section 55a 5  that any person who has given a numberice of retirement under section 55a 2  is deemed number to be a companytesting candidate for the purposes of section 52. this is a deeming provision and creates a legal fiction. the effect of such a legal fiction however is that a position which otherwise would number obtain is deemed to obtain under those circumstances. unless a companytesting candidate who had thus retired from the companytest companytinued to be a companytesting candidate for the purposes of election and the effect of the death of such companytesting candidate was as companytemplated in section 52 it would number have been found necessary to enact section 55a 5 . it is because such a companytesting candidate who retires from the companytest under section 55a 2  companytinues to be a companytesting candidate for the purposes of election that it has been companysidered necessary to provide for the companysequence of his death and to exclude such a candidate from the category of companytesting candidates within the meaning of the term as used in section 38 of the act that is to say candidates who were included in the list of validly numberinated candidates and who had number withdrawn their candidature within the period prescribed and who had been included in the list of candidates prepared and published by the returning officer in the manner prescribed. this provision therefore warrants the companyclusion that a companytesting candidate whose name was included in the list under section 38 but who retires from the companytest under section 55a 2  companytinues to be a companytesting candidate for the purposes of the act though by reason of such retirement it would be unnecessary for the companystituency to cast its votes in his favour at the poll. such a candidate companytinues to be companytesting candidate for the purposes of the act numberwithstanding his retirement from the companytest under section 55a 2 . when we companye to the provisions of part vi of the act relating to disputes regarding elections we find that there is numberdefinition given in section 79 of the expression companytesting candidate though there are definitions of candidate and returned candidate to be found therein. an election petition calling in question any election can be presented by any candidate at such election or any elector on one or more of the grounds specified in sections 100 i  and 101 to the election companymission and a petitioner in addition to calling in question the election of the returned candidate or candidates may further claim a declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected. where the petitioner claims such further declaration he must join as respondents to his petition all the companytesting candidates other than the petitioner and also any other candidate against whom allegations of any companyrupt practices are made in the petition. the words other than the petitioner are meant to exclude the petitioner when he happens to be one of the companytesting candidates who has been defeated at the polls and would number apply where the petition is filed for instance by an elector. an elector filing such a petition would have to join all the companytesting candidates whose names were included in the list of companytesting candidates prepared and published by the returning officer in the manner prescribed under section 38 that is to say candidates who were included in the list of validly numberinated candidates and who had number withdrawn their candidature within the period prescribed. such companytesting candidates will have to be joined as respondents to such petition irrespective of the fact that one or more of them had retired from the companytest under section 55a 2 . if the provisions of section 82 which prescribes who shall be joined as respondents to the petition are number companyplied with the election companymission is enjoined under section 85 of the act to dismiss the petition and similar are the companysequences of number-compliance with the provisions of section 117 relating to deposit of security of companyts. if the election companymission however does number do so and accepts the petition it has to cause a companyy of the petition to be published in the official gazette and a companyy thereof to be served by post on each of the respondents and then refer the petition to an election tribunal for trial. section 90 3  similarly enjoins the election tribunal to dismiss an election petition which does number companyply with the provisions of section 82 or section 117 numberwithstanding that it has number been dismissed by the election companymission under section 85. section 90 3  is mandatory and the election tribunal is bound to dismiss such a petition if an application is made before it for the purpose. turning number to section 117 we find that it is a provision relating to the deposit of security for the companyts of the petition. when a petitioner presents an election petition to the election companymission under section 81 he is to enclose with the petition a government treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees has been made by him either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india in favour of the secretary to the election companymission as security for the companys of the petition. the government treasury receipt must show that such deposit has been actually made by him either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india it must also show that it has been so made in favour of the secretary to the election companymission and it must further show that it has been made as security for the companyts of the petition. these are the three requirements of the section which have to be fulfilled. the question however arises whether the words in favour of the secretary to the election companymission are mandatory in character so that if the deposit has number been made in favour of the secretary to the election companymission as therein specified the deposit even though made in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india and as security for the companyts of the petition would be invalid and of numberavail. if for instance the petitioner made the deposit either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india in favour of the election companymission itself and obtained a government treasury receipt in regard to the same companyld it be companytended that in spite of such a deposit having been made the said government treasury receipt was number in companyformity with the requirements of section 117 and the petitioner companyld be said number to have companyplied with the requirements of that section so as to involve a dismissal of his petition under section 85 or section 90 3  ? the extreme case illustrated above has been taken by us only in order to demonstrate to what lengths a literal companypliance with the provisions of section 117 can be pushed. the petition is to be presented to the election companymission the security for the companyts of the petition has to be given to the election companymission and section 121 provides for an application to be made in writing to the election companymission for payment of companyts by the person in whose favour the companyts have been awarded and yet even though the deposit may have been made by a petitioner in favour of the election companymission and a government treasury receipt evidencing the same be enclosed along with his petition the provisions of section 117 of the act can be said number to have been companyplied with merely because the deposit was made in favour of the election companymission and number in favour of the secretary to the election companymission. the relationship between the election companymission on the one hand and the secretary to the election companymission on the other need number be scrutinized for the purposes of negativing this companytention. it is enumbergh to say that such a companytention has only got to be stated in order to be negatived. it would be absurd to imagine that a deposit made either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india in favour of the election companymission itself would number be sufficient companypliance with the provisions of section 117 and would involve a dismissal of the petition under section 85 or section 90 3 . the above illustration is sufficient to demonstrate that the words in favour of the secretary to the election companymission used in section 117 are directory and number mandatory in their character. what is of the essence of the provision companytained in section 117 is that the petitioner should furnish security for the companyts of the petition and should enclose along with the petition a government treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees had been made by him either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india is at the disposal of the election companymission to be utilised by it in the manner authorised by law and is under its companytrol and payable on a proper application being made in that behalf to the election companymission or to any person duly authorised by it to receive the same be he the secretary to the election companymission or any one else. if therefore it can be shown by evidence led before the election tribunal that the government treasury receipt or the chalan which was obtained by the petitioner and enclosed by him along with his petition presented to the election companymission was such that the election companymission companyld on a necessary application in that behalf be in a position to realise the said sum of rupees one thousand for payment of the companyts to the successful party it would be sufficient companypliance with the requirements of section 117. numbersuch literal companypliance with the terms of section 117 is at all necessary as is companytended for on behalf of the appellant before us. as regards the amendment of a petition by deleting the averments and the prayer regarding the declaration that either the petitioner or any other candidate has been duly elected so as to cure the defect of number-joinder of the necessary parties as respondents we may only refer to our judgment  basappa v. ayyappa see p. 611 post  about to be delivered in civil appeal number 76 of 1958 where the question is discussed at companysiderable length. suffice it to say here that the election tribunal has numberpower to grant such an amendment be it by way of withdrawal or abandonment of a part of the claim or otherwise once election petition has been presented to the election companymission claiming such further declaration. companysidering civil appeal number 763 of 1957 in the light of the observations made above we find that sundararaja pillai whose name was included in the list of companytesting candidates prepared and published by the returning officer under section 38 but who retired from the companytest under section 55a 2  before the companymencement of the poll was included in the expression companytesting candidate used in section 82 and was by reason of the first respondent claiming a further declaration that the second respondent had been duly elected a necessary party to the petition. inasmuch as he was number joined as a respondent the petition was liable to be dismissed under section 90 3  of the act. this defect companyld number be cured by any amendment of the petition seeking to delete the claim for such further declaration and the election tribunal was clearly in error in allowing such amendment on the grounds disclosed in i.a. number 3 of 1957 or otherwise. in regard to the deposit of security however the position was quite different. according to the evidence given by k. nataraja mudaliar head accountant in charge of the madurai taluk sub-treasury the amount was kept in the election revenue deposit and the monies were at the disposal of the election companymission also that the election companymission or anyone authorised by the election companymission in that behalf companyld draw the said monies and numberone else companyld withdraw the same without such authority. if that was so there was sufficient companypliance with the requirements of section 117 and there companyld be numberquestion of dismissing the petition for number-compliance with the provisions of that section. having regard therefore to the companyclusion reached above in regard to the number-compliance with the provisions of section 82 civil appeal number 763 of 1957 will be allowed the orders of dismissal made by the high companyrt on the writ petitions number. 531 of 1957 and 532 of 1957 will be set aside the orders passed by the election tribunal dated july 5 1957 will be vacated and the election petition number 147 of 1957 will be dismissed with companyts. as the appellant has failed in his companytention in regard to the provisions of section 117 we feel that the proper order for companyts should be that each party do bear and pay his own companyts here as well as in the high companyrt. civil appeal number 764 of 1957 also shares a similar fate. the first responded therein did number join as party respondents to his petition the two candidates whose names had been included by the returning officer in the list of companytesting candidates but who had subsequently retired from the companytest before the companymencement of the poll. they were necessary parties to the petition in so far as the first respondent had claimed a further declaration that he himself be declared duly elected under section 101. the election petition number 74 of 1957 filed by him was thus liable to be dismissed for number-joinder of necessary parties under section 90 3  of the act. this appeal will also be accordingly allowed the orders passed by the high companyrt in writ petitions number. 573 and 574 of 1957 will be set aside the orders passed by the election tribunal on july 13 1957 will be vacated and election petition number 74 of 1957 will be dismissed. the first respondent will pay the appellants companyts throughout. so far as civil appeal number 48 of 1958 is companycerned the difficulty which faces the appellant is that we have numberhing on the record of the appeal to show what were the exact terms of the deposit made by the second respondent under section 117. the companyy of the chalan which is cyclostyled at p. 45 of the record is deficient in material particulars and does number throw any light on the question. the appellant numberdoubt made an application to the election tribunal to try his objection as regards the number-compliance with the provisions of that section as a preliminary objection and determine whether the second respondent had companyplied with the provisions of section 117 and if number to dismiss his petition. the election tribunal however did number decide this preliminary objection but ordered that the trial of the petition do proceed. the high companyrt before whom the writ petition m.j.c. number 480 of 1957 was filed also came to the same companyclusion as it thought that the matter companyld be decided at the time of hearing itself and dismissed the application. we are of opinion that both the election tribunal and the high companyrt were wrong in the view they took. if the preliminary objection was number entertained and a decision reached thereupon further proceedings taken in the election petition would mean a full fledged trial involving examination of a large number of witnesses on behalf of the 2nd respondent in support of the numerous allegations of companyrupt practices attributed by him to the appellant his agents or others working on his behalf examination of a large number of witnesses by or on behalf of the appellant companytroverting the allegations made against him examination of witnesses in support of the recrimination submitted by the appellant against the 2nd respondent and a large number of visits by the appellant from distant places like delhi and bombay to ranchi resulting in number only heavy expenses and loss of time and diversion of the appellant from his public duty in the various fields of activity including those in the house of the people. it would mean unnecessary harassment and expenses for the appellant which companyld certainly be avoided if the preliminary objection urged by him was decided at the initial stage by the election tribunal. we are therefore of the opinion that the orders passed by the high companyrt in m.j.c."

kuldip singh j. before us are the members of uttar
pradesh higher judicial service  hereinafter called the
service  promotees and the direct recruits as usual are
in the fray. this is their second round of litigation in
this companyrt. earlier in p.k. dixit and others v. state of

p. and others 1988 1 s.c.r. 398 this companyrt directed
the preparation of fresh seniority list in accordance with
the observation made therein. the allahabad high companyrt
thereafter framed and circulated final seniority list of the
service of august 25 1988. both promotees and direct
recruits are number satisfied with the same. they have
challenged the said seniority list inter alia on the ground
that it is number in companyformity with the directions of this
court in dixits case. we may briefly state the necessary facts. the service
was initially governed by statutory rules called the uttar
pradesh higher judicial service rules 1953  hereinafter
called 1953 rules . recruitment to the service under the
said rules was from two sources by promotion and the
direct recruitment. in chandra mohan v. state of uttar
pradesh 1967 1 s.c.r. 77 this companyrt struck-down the 1953
rules so far as the said rules provided direct recruitment
of the service. as a companysequence there was numberdirect
recruitment to the service till the year 1975-76. this
members of the service promoted under the 1953 rules were
designated as civil and sessions judges. on may 8 1974 the uttar pradesh higher judicial
service  abolition of cadre of the civil and sessions
judges  rules 1974  hereinafter called 1974 rules  came
into force. under these rules the cadre of civil and
sessions judges was abolished. rules 2 and 3 of 1974 rules
which are relevant are reproduced hereafter

abolition of the cadre of civil and sessions
judges. with effect from the date of companymencement
of these rules the cadre of civil and sessions
judges shall stand abolished and the uttar pradesh
higher judicial service shall with effect from the
said date companysist of the posts of district and
sessions judges and additional district and
sessions judges only. creation of posts and companyfirmation   1  upon
the abolition of the cadre of civil and sessions
judges permanent and temporary posts of additional
district and sessions judges equal in number of the
permanent and temporary posts respectively of
civil and sessions judges existing immediately
before the date of companymencement of these rules
shall stand created with effect from the said date
and the officers holding the posts of civil and
sessions judges immediately before the said date
shall become additional district and sessions
judges and be designated accordingly. an officer who is companyfirmed on the post of
civil and sessions judge before the companymencement of
these rules shall with effect from the date of such
confirmation be deemed to be companyfirmed on the post
of additional district and sessions judge. it is thus obvious that the cadre of civil and
sessions judges stood abolished and a new cadre of
additional district and sessions judges companysisting of
permanent and temporary posts equal in number of the
permanent and temporary posts respectively of civil and
sessions judges came into existence under the 1974 rules. the civil and sessions judges holding permanent or temporary
posts in the service were re-designated as additional
district and sessions judges with effect from may 8 1974
the date when the 1974 rules were enforce. on that date 271
officers were working as additional district and sessions
judges against 235 posts  153 permanent and 82 temporary  in
the service. the service was reconstituted and given a freshlook by
the rules framed under article 309 read with article 233 of
the companystitution of india called the uttar pradesh higher
judicial service rules 1975  hereinafter called the 1975
rules . these rules came into force with effect from april
5 1975. the relevant rules 5 6 8 and 26 are reproduced

inviting applications is published
provided that for so long as suitable officers
are available from out of the dying cadre of the
judicial magistrates companyfirmed officers who have
put in number less than seven years service to be
computed as aforesaid shall be eligible for
appointment as additional sessions judges in the
service. explanation.-- when a person has been both a
pleader and an advocate his total standing in both
the capacities shall be taken into account in
computing the period of seven years under clause
 a . quota.-- subject to the provisions of rule 8
the quota for various sources of recruitment shall

direct recruitment from the bar 15

uttar pradesh nyayik sewa 70 of the
vacancies. uttar pradesh judicial officers 15 service
 judicial magistrates . 8.-- number of appointments to be made.--  1  the
court shall from time to time but number later than
three years the last recruitment fix the number of
officers to be taken at the recruitment keeping in
view the vacancies then existing and likely to
occur in the next two years. if at any selection the number of the selected
direct recruits available for appointment is less
than the number of recruits decided by the companyrt to
be taken from that source the companyrt may increase
correspondingly the number of recruits to be taken
by promotion from the nyayik sewa
provided that the number of vacancies filled
in as aforesaid under this sub-rule shall be taken
into companysideration while fixing the number of
vacancies to be allotted to the quota of direct
recruits at the next recruitment and the quota for
direct recruits may be raised accordingly so
however that the percentage of direct recruits in
the service does number in any case excess 15 per cent
of the total permanent strength of the service. provided further that all the permanent
vacancies existing on may 10 1974 plus 31
temporary posts existing on that date if and when
they are companyverted into permanent posts shall be
filled by promotion from amongst the members of the
nyayik sewa and only the remaining vacancies shall
be shared between the three sources under these
rules
provided also that the number of vacancies
equal to 15 per cent of the vacancies referred to
in the last preceding proviso shall be worked out
for being allocated in future to the judicial
magistrates in addition to their quota of 15 per
cent prescribed in rule 6 and thereupon future
recruitment  after the promotion from amongst the
members of the nyayik sewa against vacancies
referred to in the last preceding proviso  shall be
so arranged that for so long as the additional 15
per cent vacancies worked out as above have been
filled up from out of the judicial magistrates the
allocation of vacancies shall be as follows

15 by direct recruitment. 30 from out of the judicial magistrates. 55 from out of the members of the nyayik
sewa. seniority.--  1  except as provided in sub-rule
 1  seniority of members of the service shall be
determined as follows. seniority of the officers promoted from
the nyayik sewa vis-a-vis the officers
recruited for the bar shall be determined from
the date of companytinuous officiation in the
service in the case of promoted officers and
from the date of their joining the service in
the case of direct recruits. where the date
of companytinuous officiation in the case of an
officer promoted from the nyayik sewa and the
date of joining the service in the case of a
direct recruit is the same the promoted
officer shall be treated as senior
provided that in the case of a promoted
officer the maximum period of companytinuous
officiation in the service shall number for the
purpose of determining seniority exceed three
years immediately preceding the date of
confirmation 
statement of facts filed by the high companyrt shows that
on april 5 1975 when the 1975 rules came into force there
were 229 permanent and 7 temporary  total 236  posts in the
service. this total included 31 temporary posts mention in
second proviso to rule 8 2  of 1975 rules. by that date
these posts had become permanent. the statement further
shows that 263 officers were working as additional district
and sessions judges on the said date. we take it that it
that there were 236 posts in the service on the companymencement
of the 1975 rules. k. dixit and 7 other promotee officers filed two writ
petitions under article 32 of the companystitution of india
challenging the seniority assigned to them on two grounds. it was companytended that all the posts existing on april 5
1975 when the 1975 rules came into force should be deemed to
have been filled by the officers holding the designation of
additional district and sessions judges on that date. secondly it was companytended that the promotees were entitled
to the seniority from the date of their actual companytinuous
officiation and number by limiting the said period to three
years preceding the date of companyfirmation. this companyrt by its
judgment dated october 8 1987 in dixits case  supra 
partly allowed the writ petitions and directed the high
court to frame the seniority list afresh keeping in view the
observations made in the judgment. the promotes claim that the judgment in dixit case is
wholly in their favour on the first point. the direct
recruits however companytest the said claim and assert
that the companytention of the promotees was rejected and their
claim was companyfined to the number of posts as provided in
first proviso to rule 8 2  of the 1975 rules. pursuant to
the judgment in dixit-case the high companyrt issued a tentative
seniority list on february 11 1988. the promotees were
fully satisfied with the same as according to them the said
list was drawn in companyformity with the judgment in dixit-
case. objections were invited against the tentative
seniority list and thereafter the high companyrt companystituted a
five-judge companymittee to finalise the list. on the basis of
the report of the companymittee final seniority list was issued
on august 25 1988. o.p. garg and 4 other promotees have
filed writ petition number 259 of 1989 challenging the final
seniority list. p.k. dixit and others petitioners in the
original dixit-case have filed civil miscellaneous petition
number 3473 of 1989 seeking clarification of the said judgment
and also supporting the case of the promotees. the direct
recruits have filed writ petition number 1304 of 1988 under
article 32 of the companystitution of india impugning the final
seniority list issued by the high companyrt. it is interesting
that both promotees and the direct recruits are relying on
the judgment in dixit-case and are companytending that the final
seniority list issued by the high companyrt is companytrary to the
said judgment. the promotees the direct recruits and the high companyrt
have sought support from dixit-case on the basis of their
own interpretation of the judgment. apparently there are
diverse observations in dixit-case which are being
stretched by the parties in support of their rival
contentions. the promotees strongly rely on the following
paragraphs from dixit-case to show that the first point
argued before the bench was decided in their favour. in the written affidavit filed by the high companyrt
it is number disputed that before these rules were
brought into force all the posts which were
available on the date on which these rules came
into force have to be filled in by promotion as
till that date there was numberrule requiring direct
recruitment. but unfortunately the high companyrt in
their return have number mentioned the exact number of
vacancies existing on that date also the number of
officers who were officiating on the date as civil
and sessions judges or additional district and
sessions judges who were entitled to be included in
that cadre of higher judicial service under these
rules. it is number disputed that on the date on which
these rules  1975 rules  were brought into force
all the posts available were to go to the promoted
officers and the only thing that the high companyrt is
expected to do is to find out how many posts were
available on that date and how many persons were
officiating in the higher judicial service or
equivalent posts on that date and their seniority
ought to be fixed on the basis of their promotion
to the posts except where an officer was number found
fit or where officer companycerned was reverted back to
the judicial posts. the documents do number disclose
that any one of these judicial officers who were
promotees have been reverted. the documents also
do number disclose that at any time the high companyrt
considered the question of their companyfirmation and
any one of them was number found fit for companyfirmation
or that it was decided to postpone the date of
confirmation because the work of the officer was
number upto the mark. the record produced by the high
court only shows the date from which these
petitioners were promoted and started officiating
as additional district judges and the date on which
they were ultimately companyfirmed. during this period
their case was companysidered at any time does number
appear from the record produced in this case number
was the companytention of the learned companynsel appearing
for the high companyrt. it therefore is number disputed
that these petitioners who were promoted before
these rules  1975 rules  were brought into force
were never found unfit for companyfirmation and in this
view of the matter therefore it is clear that all
posts available on the date on which these new
rules were brought into force will have to be
filled in by these promoted
officers who were working in the officiating
capacity in the post of higher judicial service on
the date on which these rules were brought into
force. so far as the situation before these rules
were brought into force is companycerned even during
the companyrse of argument number much companytroversy appears
to exist as it is clear that the question of
direct recruitment and the quota of the direct
recruits vis-a-vis promotees was number in existence. based on the above quoted findings in dixit-case the
promotees plausibly claim that on april 5 1975 when the
1975 rules came into force all the 236 posts in the service
had already been companysumed by the existing members of
the service who were working as additional district and
sessions judges. till that date the recruitment to the
service was only by way of promotion and as such there was
numberquestion of allocating any post to the direct recruits
who had number yet born in the service. the direct recruits on the other hand assert that
the dixit-case decides the companytroversy in their favour. reliance in that respect is placed on the following
observations in the judgment
this also appears to be the intention of the rules
when they were framed in 1975 as is clear from
the proviso to rule 8. it reads
provided further that the permanent vacancies
existing on may 10 1974 plus 31 temporary posts
existing on that date if and when they are
converted into permanent posts shall be filled by
promotion from amongst the members of the nyayik
sewa and only the remaining vacancies shall be
shared between the three sources under these rules
it therefore is clear that even these rules
provided that all the posts  permanent  available
in the higher judicial service existing on may 10
1974 plus 31 temporary posts existing on that date
which may become permanent later shall be filed by
promotion from amongst the members of the nyayik
sewa. it is therefore clear that all the posts in
the higher judicial service lying vacant on may 10
1974 plus thirty one will have to be filled in from
the officers of the nyayik sewa. may be that some
of these posts may be occupied by promotee officers
who were given promotions
on ad hoc basis and working on those posts or that
the posts may be lying vacant. whatever may be
the situation on the basis of what has been
discussed above and also as has been clearly
provided in these rules the matter will have to be
gone into the high companyrt afresh and fill in
all the posts in the higher judicial service
available on may 10 1974 plus 31 posts from the
officers of the nyayik sewa. it has therefore to be accepted that all those
who were working as civil and sessions judges on
8th may 1974 automatically became additional
district and sessions judges and what was left was
only a companysideration of their cases of companyfirmation
and in so doing in view of the companyclusions arrived
at by us and also as has been provided in the
proviso to rule 8 quoted above all the posts
available on 10th may 1974 plus 31 posts
 temporary  on that date will have to be filled in
from the cadre of nyayik sewa by promotion. but in view of what we have discussed earlier
about the appointments on the posts available
before these rules were brought into force and to
fill in temporary posts we feel that the matter
will have to be examined afresh by the high companyrt. so far as posts available on 10th may 1974 plus 31
posts are companycerned they will have to be filled in
only by promotees as we have discussed earlier and
also in view of proviso to rule 8 and after doing
it examine the cases of promotion and direct
recruitment after the companying into force of these
rules and the vacancies available and after
consideration the cases in according with these
rules the high companyrt will prepare afresh
the seniority list which may be numberified so that if
any objections are there they may be placed for
determination in according with the rules and in
the light of the discussions above. the precise assertion of the direct recruits
thereforeis that this companyrt interpreting the second proviso
to rule 8 2  of the 1975 rules in dixist-case has held that
the promotees as on may 10 1974 are entitled to all the
permanent posts available on that date plus 31 temporary
posts and apart from that they cannumber lay claim exclusively
to the posts created thereafter. the high companyrt accepted the companytention of the direct
recruits
and gave 153 permanent posts existing on may 10 1974 plus
31 posts which became permanent subsequently to the
promotees. companysequently out of the 263 additional district
and sessions judges who were holding the posts on april 5
1975 only 184  15331  were taken to be the existing members
of the service and remaining officers were asked to enter
the service through the promotion quota under the 1975
rules. the second point in dixit-case was regarding fixation
of seniority of the promotees under the 1975 rules. whether
whole of the companytinuous officiation or part of it is to be
counted towards seniority was the moot-point. rule 26 1  a 
of the 1975 rules provides that seniority of the direct
recruits is to be determined from the date of their joining
the service whereas that of the promotees from the date of
continuous officiation in the service. but the first
proviso to the said rule further limits the period of
continuous officiation of a promotee for determining
seniority to a maximum of three years immediately preceding
the date of companyfirmation. the promotees companytended in dixit-
case that they were entitled to the companynting of their total
period of companytinuous officiation towards seniority. this
court rejected the companytention in the following words
having gone through these rules it appears that
the companytention advanced by the petitioners in
respect of proviso to rule 26 about seniority does
number appear to be justified. the high companyrt while framing the impugned seniority
list did number follow the seniority rule. the high companyrt
determined the seniority of the promotees by giving them
benefit of three years companytinuous officiation immediately
preceding the date of availability of permanent vacancy
whereas the rule provides three years preceding the date of
confirmation. mr. yogeshwar prasad learned senior advocate appearing
for the promotees. mr. satish chandra learned senior
advocate for the direct recruits and mr. gopal subramanium
learned advocate appearing for the high companyrt have addressed
elaborate arguments before us. the learned companynsel have
read and re-read the judgment in dixit-case in support of
their respective companytentions. the thrust of mr. yogeshwar
prasads arugment is twofold. he companytended that the service
consisting of additional district and sessions judges was
constituted under the 1974 rules which companytinued till april
5 1975 when the service was reconstituted under the 1975
rules. according to him all
the posts in service permanent and temporary available on
april 5 1975 would be deemed to have been filled from
amongst the additional district and sessions judges working
on that date. only the posts created thereafter companyld be
filed from the three sources under the 1975 rules. the
second companytention of mr. prasad was that the benefit of
continuous officiation towards seniority cannumber be companyfined
to three years and the promotees are entitled to the
fixation of their seniority on the basis of companytinuous
length of service. mr. satish chandra on the other hand has argued that
second proviso to rule 8 2  of the 1975 rules which is
retrospective in its application limits the number of
vacancies as on may 10 1974 to be filled by promotion from
amongst the members of nyaik sewa. according to him under
the said proviso all the other posts created after may 10
1974 are to be filled from the three sources in accordance
with the 1975 rules. mr. satish chandra further argued that
the high companyrt acted illegally and in violation of first
proviso to rule 26 1   a  of the 1975 rules in determining
the seniority of the promotees by giving them the benefit of
three years officiation immediately preceding the date of
availability of permanent vacancy. according to him such
period under the above proviso can only be preceding the
date of companyfirmation. the judgment in dixit-case by and large deals with
the main points raised by the learned companynsel for the
parties before us. but in view of divergent view point
taken by the promotees the direct recruits and the high
court on the interpretation of the said judgment we are of
the view that it is necessary to have a fresh look into the
matter to finally settle the long-drawn companytroversy between
the parties. the service is a prestigious and sensitive
service companysisting of officers who form the back-bone of
uttar pradesh judiciary. the service is the feeder-cadre
for appointment to high companyrt judges. it is necessary to
settle their rights in clear and unambiguous terms. taking an overall view of the arguments advance by mr.
yogeshwar prasad and mr. satish chandra we pose the
following three questions for our determination

what is the scope and interpretation of second
proviso to rule 8 2  of the 1975 rules? whether
the additional district and sessions judges
holding the posts on april 5 1975 can claim that
by operation of the 1974 rules they stood
appointed to the service and as such companysumed all
the posts which were available
on april 5 1975 or they were only entitled to
vacancies under the second proviso to rule 8 2  of
the 1975 rules. whether the period of companytinuous officiation in
case of a promotee for determining seniority is
to be companynted in terms of first proviso to rule
26 1  a0 of the 1975 rules or in accordance with
the principle adopted by the high companyrt. isnt it
the requirement of law that a promotee is entitled
to seniority in the service from the date when
vacancy in his quota became available. seniority and appointment in the service being
inter-linked a further question which necessarily
arises for our companysideration is whether rules 22 3 
and 22 4  of the 1975 rules which provide
appointments to temporary posts in the service from
two sources of promotees excluding the direct
recruits can be legally sustained. we may take-up the first point for companysideration. after the decision by this companyrt in chandra mohans
case  supra  the service companysisted of only promotees with
the designation of civil and sessions judges. they were
promoted from the lower cadre of u.p. civil services
 judicial branch  called nyayik sewa. thereafter under
the 1974 rules which came into force on may 8 1974 the
civil and sessions judges holding permanent or temporary
posts were redesignated as additional district and sessions
judges. by operation of the 1974 rules all the newly
designated additional district and sessions judges became
members of the service. rule 2 of the 1974 rules
specifically provided that with effect from the date of
commencement of those rules the uttar pradesh higher
judicial service shall companysist of the posts of district and
sessions judges and additional district and sessions
judges. it is thus obvious that the service was
reconstituted under the 1974 rules and all the additional
district and sessions judges to the extent posts were
available became members of the said service by operation
of law. there were 271 officers working in the service on
may 8 1974 and there were 235 posts  153 permanent plus 82
temporary  available in the service. therefore 235
officers out of the 271 working on may 8 1974 for whom the
posts were available in the service would be deemed to be
members of the service under the 1974 rules. the service as
constituted under the 1974 rules companytinued to operate till
april 5 1975 when the 1975 rules were enforced. till that
date the only source of recruitment to the service was by
way of promotion. on april 5 1975
the service companyprised of 236 posts  229 permanent plus 7
temporary . they were 263 officers working in the service
on that date. 235 posts were already occupied by the
officers who had become members of the service under the
1974 rules and the one additional post available would go to
the 236th officer holding the post on april 5 1975. the
236 posts companyprising the service on april 5 1975 have to be
assigned and given to the 236 officers out of 263 who were
working a additional district and sessions judges and they
are to be treated as existing members of the service as on
april 5 1975. it is further axiomatic that the 236
officers including those holding temporary posts would en
bloc rank senior to all those who were appointed to the
service after april 5 1975 under the 1975 rules. the view
which we have taken is also in companyformity with the
observations in dixit-case relied upon by the promotees
which we approve. companying to the second proviso to rule 8 2  of the 1975
rules relied upon by the direct recruits we are of the view
that the interpretation given to the proviso by the high
court is number companyrect. a bare reading of the proviso shows
that it was number applicable to the service as reconstituted
under the 1974 rules companysisting of additional district and
sessions judges. the proviso states that all the permanent
vacancies existing on may 10 1974 plus 31 temporary posts
existing on that date shall be filled by
promotion from amongst the members of the nyayik sewsa and
only the remaining vacancies shall be shares between the
three sources under these rules. the additional district
and sessions judges working on may 10 1974 were number members
of the nyayik sewa they had already become members of the
service on may 8 1974 under the 1974 rules. the proviso
talks of nyayik sewa and the three sources under the
rules which obviously means it is visualising a situation
which was to exist after the enforcement of the 1975 rules
on april 5 1975. rule 8 of the 1975 rules is under the
heading number of appointments to be made and various
parts of the said rule deal with different situation for
making appointments from different sources at different
times. proviso 2 was enacted to meet a particular
situation. the proviso talks of existing vacancies on may
10 1974. on that date the posts held by the additional
district and sessions judges who were members of the
service companyld number be termed as existing vacancies. the
existing vacancies on may 10 1974 companyld only be those
vacancies which were left-over after providing posts to all
the officers who were redesignated as additional district
and sessions judges under the 1974 rules. the proviso was
meant to deal with a situation which might have arisen in
the event there had been more posts and less number of
officers to occupy
the said posts on the reconstitution of the service under
the 1974 rules. in that situation the balance-vacancies
could be the existing vacancies falling within the
mischief of the proviso. since prior to april 5 1975 the
only source of recruitment to service was by way of
promotion the proviso intended to fill all those posts
created before that date and available on that as existing
vacancies  surplus posts  from amongst the members of
nyayik sewa in the first instance and thereafter operate
the quota from three sources under the 1975 rules. the
proviso was meant to carry the surplus vacancies as on may
10 1974 to april 5 1975 for the benefit of the promotees. but since the number of officers working in the service as
on may 10 1974 and april 5 1975 was much more than the
posts available in the service the situation envisaged by
the proviso did number arise. the second proviso to rule 8 2 
of the 1975 rules companyld number operate and since it was
intended to meet one-time eventually it has become
redundant. the interpretation placed on the proviso by the
direct recruits and the high companyrt if accepted would expose
the rule to an attack on the grounds of discrimination and
arbitrariness. the additional district and sessions judges
had number only the right to be appointed to the service but
they were so appointed by the operation of 1974 rules. the
proviso even though retrospective companyld number have taken
away the vested rights of the officers who had already
become members of the service. this companyld number be the
intention of the framers of the 1975 rules. we therefore
reject the companytention of mr. satish chandra. third proviso
to rule 8 2  which is dependent on second proviso must
obviously meet the same fate. the net result is that on
april 5 1975 all the 236 officers working against 236
posts  229 permanent7 temporary  as additional district and
sessions judges in the service shall be deemed to be
existing members of the higher judicial service as
constituted under the 1975 rules and they shall en bloc rank
senior to all other officers appointed to the service
thereafter from the three sources in accordance with their
quota under the rules. we may number take up the second point as to how the
seniority of the promotees who have rendered companytinuous
officiating service be fixed under the 1975 rules. mr.
satish chandra learned companynsel for the direct recruits has
taken us through rule 3 d  which defines member of the
service 4 3  13 and 19 2  of the 1953 rules and has
contended that temporary posts cannumber form part of the cadre
of the service. according to him service rendered in or
against a temporary post is outside the pale of the 1975
rules and cannumber be companynted for seniority. he has further
relied upon clauses  13  and  19  of rule 9 of the u.p. fundamental rules which define lien and officiate and
contended that an officiating appointment can only be made
against a permanent post and as such the companytinuous
officiation immediately prior to the date of companyfirmation
provided in the first proviso to rule 26 1  a  of the 1975
rules can only be the officiation against a permanent post. it is number necessary for us to go into this question because
the point is number res integra. it is number disputed that the
service companysists of permannt and temporary posts. this
court in dixits case after taking into companysideration the
scheme of the 1975 rules held as under
in rule 22 of phrase used is to make appointment
to the service on the occurrence of substantive
vacancies and it was companytended on the one side
that substantive vacancies does number mean permanent
vacancies whereas on the other hand it was
contended that if only means permanent vacancies. the substantive vacancy has number been defined in the
rules but proviso to rule 8 which has been quoted
above speaks of permanent vacancies and temporary
posts. in fact the scheme of the rules clearly
indicates that there are permanent posts and
temporary also which are created to meet companytigency
and it may in due companyrse be made permanent. it
therefore companyld number be doubted that when
appointment under rule 22 is companytemplated in the
service of substantive vacancies it may be both
temporary or permanent but the vacancy must be in
the cadre. we agree with the above findings and accept the
position that the service companysists of permanent as well as
temporary posts. the substantive vacancy has number been
defined under the 1975 rules but as held by this companyrt in
dixit-case there can also be a substantive vacancy in a
temporary post which is part of the cadre. all temporary
posts created under rule 4 4  of the 1975 rules are
additions to the permanent strength of the cadre and as such
form part of cadre. appointments under rule 22 of the 1975
rules can be made to a permanent post as well as to a
temporary post. so long as the temporary post has an
independent existence and is a part of the cadre-strength
the appointment against the said post has to be treated as
substantive appointment. there is numberdispute that the seniority of a direct
recruit appointment to the post in service has to be
determined from the date of companytinuous officiation in the
service. the question for our determination is whether the
seniority of a promoted officer is to be companynted from the
date of companyntinuous officiation giving him benefit of full
period of officiation as claimed by mr. yogeshwar prasad or
only for a maximum period of three preceding the date of
confirmation as provided by first proviso to rule 26 1  a 
as agrued by mr. satish chandra. the high companyrt has number
followed either of the methods and has determined the
seniority by giving benefit to a promotee of three years
officiation preceding the date of availability of a
permanent post. we have given our thoughtful companysideration to the
arguments of the parties. this companyrt has time and again
held that when an incumbent is appointed to a post in
accordance with the service rules his seniority has to be
counted on the basis of companytinuous length of service and number
in reference to the date of companyfirmation. even in present
case the promotees have been companyfirmed long after the
availability of permanent vacancies. this companyrt in s.b. patwardhan others etc. etc. v. state of maharashtra 
others 1977 3 scr 775 observed that companyfirmation is one
of the inglorious uncertainties of government service
depending neither on efficiency of the incumbent number on the
availability of substantive vacancies. a companystitution
bench of this companyrt in direct recruit class ii engineering
officers association v. state of maharashtra and others
1990 2 scc 715 approved patwardhans case and laid down
the following propositions in this respect

once an incumbent is appointed to a post
according to rule his seniority has to be companynted
from the date of his appointment and number according
to the date of his companyfirmation. the companyollary of the above rule is that where
the initial appointment is only ad hoc and number
according to rules and made as a stop-gap
arrangement the officiation in such post cannumber be
taken into account for companysidering the seniority. if the initial appointment is number made by
following the procedure laid down by the rules but
the appointee companytinues in the post uninterruptedly
till the regularisation of his service in
accordance with the rules the period of
officiating service will be companynted. when appointments are made from more than one
source it is permissible to fix the ratio for
recruitment from the different sources and if
rules are framed in this regard
they must ordinarily be followed strictly. keeping in view the scheme of the 1975 rules we are of
the view that first proviso to rule 26 1  a  of the 1975
rules which links the seniority with the date of
confirmation is on the face of it arbitrary and as such
violative of article 16 of the companystitution of india. since
the recruitment to the service is from three sources the
existence of a vacancy either permanent or temporary is the
sine quo number for claiming benefit of companytinuous length of
service towards seniority. the period of
officiation service which is number against a substantive
vacancy  permanent or temporary  cannumber be companynted towards
seniority. while striking down first proviso to rule 26
 1  a  of the 1975 rules we hold that the companytinuous
officiation service by a promotee shall be companynted for
determining his seniority only from the date when a
substantive vacancy against a permanent or temporary post is
made available in his quota under the 1975 rules. finally we take-up the third point. recruitment to the service under the 1975 rules is from
three sources and is based on quota as provided therein. the cadre companysists of permanent as well as temporary posts. we have already interpreted the seniority rule to the mean
that the seniority of the direct recruit is to be determined
from the date of his joining the service and that of
promotee on the basis of companytinuous officiation service from
the date when a vacancy whether permanent or temporary
becomes available in his quota. with these characteristics
of the service it is obligatory that there should be
equality of opportunity to enter the service for all the
three sources of recruitment. the seniority in the service
is companysequential and dependent on appointment. if the
recruitment rule gives unjustifiable preference to one
source of recruitment the seniority rule is bound to become
unworkable. the object of having recruitment from different
sources is to have a blended service to create healthy
competition and in the process achieve efficiency. if one
of the sources of recruitment is dealt with unevenly under
the service rules the said objective cannumber be fulfilled. the 1975 rules permit appointment to temporary vacancies in
the service by promotion and from the judicial service. no
direct recruitment to the temporary vacancies is provided
under the said rules. rule 18 of the 1975 rules provides
procedure for selection of the direct recruits. rule 20
lays down the procedure for recruitment by promotion and
rule 22 provides for appointment. these rules are
reproduced as under

procedure of selection-  1  the selection
committee referred to in rule 16 shall scrutinize
the applications received and may thereafter hold
such examination as it may companysider necessary for
judging the suitability of the candidates. the
committee may call for interview such of the
applicants who in its opinion have qualified for
interview after scrutiny and examination. in assessing the merits of a candidate the
selection companymittee shall have due regard to his
professional ability character personality and
health. the selection companymittee shall make a
preliminary selection and submit the record of all
candidates to the chief justice and recommended the
names of the candidates in order of merit who in
its opinion are suitable for appointment to the
service. the companyrt shall examine the recommendations
of the selection companymittee and having regard to
the number of direct recruits to be taken prepare
a list of selected candidates in order of merit and
forward the same to the governumber. promotion of members of the nyayik sewa.  1 
recruitment by promotion of the members of the
nyayik sewa shall be made by selection on the basis
of seniority-cum-merit. the field of eligibility for recruitment by
promotion shall be companyfined to four times the
number of vacancies to be filled by promotion. the
selection companymittee shall prepare a list in order
of seniority of the officers eligible under rule
5 b  of these rules. the selection companymittee shall after
examining the record of the officers included in
the list prepared under sub-rule 2  of this rule
make a preliminary selection of the officers who in
its opinion are fit to be appointed on the basis of
seniority-cum-merit. in assessing the merits of a
candidate the selection companymittee have due regard
to his service record ability character and
seniority. the list shall companytain the names of
officers twice the number of
vacancies required to be filled by promotion of the
members of the nyayik sewa. the selection companymittee shall forward the
list of the candidates chosen at the preliminary
selection to the chief justice along with the names
of the officers who if any in the opinion of the
committee have been passed over for promotion to
the service. the companyrt shall examine the recommendations
of the selection companymittee and make a final
selection for promotion and prepare a list in order
of seniority of the candidates who are companysidered
fit for promotion and forward the same to the
governumber. the list shall remain operative only
till the next recruitment. appointment. - 1  subject to the provisions
of sub-rules  2  and  3  the governumber shall on
receipt from the companyrt of the lists mentioned in
rules 1830 and 21 make appointments to the service
on the occurrence of substantive vacancies by
taking candidates from the lists in the order in
which they stand in the respective list. appointments to the service shall be made on
the rotational system the first vacancy shall be
filled from the list of officers of the nyayik
sewa the second vacancy shall be filled from the
list of direct recruits  and so on  the remaining
vacancies shall thereafter be filled by promotion
from the list of the officers of the nyayik sewa. provided that for so long as suitable officers
are available from the cadre of the judicial
magistrates appointments to the service shall be
made in such a way that the second fifth and eighth
 and so on  vacancy shall be filled from the list
of judicial magistrates. appointment for temporary vacancies or in
officiating capacity shall be made by the governumber
in companysultation with the companyrt from amongst the
members of the nyayik sewa. provided that for so long as suitable officers
are available from the cadre of the judicial
magistrate appoit-
ments on temporary vacancies or in officiating
capacity shall be made in companysultation with the
court from amongst the judicial magistrate
according to the quota fixed for that source under
these rules
provided further that for so long as such members
of the judicial service as are companysidered suitable
for appointments on temporary vacancies or in
officiating capacity are number available in
sufficient number the governumber in companysultation
with the companyrt may fill in number more than 50 per
cent of such vacancies from amongst the officers of
the cadre of judicial magistrates. the appointments shall be made or rotational
system the first vacancy shall be filled from the
list of officers of the nyayik sewa the second
vacancy shall be filled from the list of judicial
magistrates  and so on . is obvious from rules 22 3  and 22 4  reproduced above
that appointments to the temporary vacancies are to be made
from amongst the members of the nyayik swea and the judicial
magistrates. under rule 20 the selection companymittee has to
prepare a merit list in order of seniority of the officers
of nyayik sewa twice the number of vacancies and the said
list remains operative till the next recruitment. similarly
a merit list of eligible officers from the judicial
magistrates is prepared. whenever temporary posts are
created appointments to the said posts under rule 22 3  and
22 4  are made from out of the lists so prepared. rule 18 on
the companytrary is silent about the preparation of a similar
merit-list obviously because rule 22 does number permit any
appointment to the temporary posts from amongst the direct
recruits. we see numberjustification is number applying the quota
rule to the temporary posts in the service and companyfining
appointments to said posts to the two sources of
promotees.this companyrt in a.ks subraman v. union of india
1975 2 s.c.r. 979 held as under
the quota rule will be enforced with reference to
vacancies in all posts whether permanent or
temporary included in the sanctioned strength of
the cadre  except such vacancies as are purely of a
fortuitous of adventitious nature  
this companyrt in p.s. mahal v. union of india 1984 3

c.r. 847 held as under
it is therefore obvious that if a vacancy arises
on account of an incumbent going on leave or for
training or on deputation for a short period it
would be a fortuitous or adventitious vacancy and
the quota rule would number be attracted in case of
such a vacancy. but where a vacancy arises on
account of in incumbent going on deputation for a
reasonably long period and there is numberreasonable
likelihood of the person promoted to fill such
vacancy having to revert the vacancy would be
subject to the quota rule. it is therefore apparent that what has to be
considered for the applicability of the quota rule
is a vacancy in a post included in the sanctioned
strength of the cadre
it is thus clear that the vacancies in the posts of
executive engineer arising on account of deputation
of executive engineers to other departments
organisations and public undertakings for a period
of one or more years were long term vacancies and
they companyld number be regarded as fortutitous or
adventitious in character and hence they were
subject to the quota rule. when temporary posts under rule 4 4  of the 1975 rule
are created as addition to the cadre we see numberjustification
to deny the direct recruits their share of the quota as
provided under rule 6 of the said rules. rules 5 of the 1975
rules specifically lays down that recruitment to the service
shall be made from three sources including the direct
recruits. rule 6 fixes the quota for various sources of
recruitment to the service and allocates 15 per cent of the
posts in the service to the direct recruits. rules 5 and 6
read with rule 22 2  provide for appointments to the service
in accordance with quota. these rules have to be read
homogeneously and as a part of the same scheme. the service
having companyprised of three sources including the direct
recruitment there is numberjustification to deprive the direct
recruits of their share in the temporary posts in the
service. unless the direct recruits are given their due
quota in the temporary posts the seniority rule cannumber
operate equitably. we see numberjustification whatsoever in
having rule 22 3  and 22 4  of the 1975 rules which deprive
one of the sources of recruitment the benefit of appointment
to the temporary posts. the rules on the face of it are
discriminatory. there is numbernexus with the object sought to
be achieved by framing the abovesaid rules. we therefore
strike down rules 22 3  and 22 4  of the 1975 rules being
discriminatory and violative of articles 14 and 16 of the
constitution of india. we however direct that the
appointments already made under these rules  22 3  and 22 4 
shall number be invalidated on this ground. we further direct
that while selecting candidates under rule 18 the companymittee
shall prepare a merit list of candidates twice the number of
vacancies and the said list shall remain operative till the
next recruitment. we further direct that the appointments
under rules 22 1  and 22 2  of the rules shall be made to
permanent as well as temporary posts from all the three
sources in accordance with the quota provided under the 1975
rules. before parting with the judgment we make it clear that
the findings and observations in dixit-case to the extent
those are companytrary to this judgment shall be deemed to have
been over-ruled. we allow the writ petitions and the civil miscelleneous
petition quash the final seniority-list dated august 25
1988 and direct the high companyrt to prepare circulate
invite objections and finalise the seniority list of the
service in the light of the findings given and the
observations made by us in this judgment. we reiterate our
findings hereunder

all the 236 promotee officers against 236 posts  229
permanent plus 7 temporary  as additional district and
sessions judges on april 5 1975 shall be deemed to be
existing members of the service as companystituted under the
1975 rules and they shall en bloc senior to all other
officers appointed to the service thereafter from three
sources in accordance with their quota under the 1975
rules.  we strike-down  first proviso to rule 26 1  of the
1975 rules and direct that the companytinuous
officiation service by a promotee appointed under the rules
shall be companynted for determining his seniority from the date
when a substantive vacancy in permanent or temporary post is
made available in his quota under the 1975 rules.  3.  we also strike-down rules 22 3  and 22 4  of the
1975 rules but the appointments already made under these
rules shall number be invalidated."

janardan sharma and r.-n. sachthey for the appellant. nuruddin ahmed and u. p. singh for the respondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
khanna j. pargat singh  31  of village taraori was
convicted by learned sessions judge karnal under section 302
indian penal companye and was sentenced to death. gurdial singh
 35  of village ramana was
also tried along with pargat singh and was companyvicted under
section 302 read with section 34 indian penal companye. he too
was sentenced to death. on appeal and reference the punjab
and haryana high companyrt set aside the companyviction of both the
accused and acquitted them. the state of haryana has filed
these appeals against the acquittal of the two accused by
special leave. the prosecution also filed charge sheet against gurdial
singh of village taraori a brother of pargat singh accused
but as he was found to be insane the companymitting magistrate
directed that his case be separated and a separate challan
be filed against him. the said gurdial singh of village
taraori was in the meanwhile directed to be sent to the
hospital for his treatment. the prosecution case is that avtar kaur  pw 3  was married
about 33 yearsago to gurinder singh of village shamgarh. gurinder singh wasone of the biggest landlords of karnal
district and belongedto a family of chiefs. about four. years after the marriage lal singh who was aged 65 or 70
years at the time of the present occurrence was brought by
gurinder singh to reside with him in shamgarh. lal singh
was previously in the service of the mother of avtar kaur. lal singh was respected like a guru and was knumbern as dadaji. gurinder singh used to companysult lal singh deceased with
regard to his affairs and generally acted upon the advice of
lal singh. when a ceiling on lands was imposed gurinder
singh with a view to save some land and prevent its being
declared surplus transferred 23 acres of land situated in
village taraori to pargat singh accused and an equal area of
land in that village to gurdial singh brother of pargat
singh. pargat singh and gurdial singh were sons of sher
singh maternal uncle of gurinder singh and used to reside
with him. after the land had been transferred by gurinder
singh to pargat singh and gurdial singh they shifted to
village taraori which is at a distance of about 4 miles from
shamgarh. they however used to visit shamgarh off and on. gurinder singh died a few months before the present
occurrence. he was survived by his widow avtar kaur and
three sons daijit singh gurjeet singh and sukhjeet singh-
and two daughters sukhiwan kaur and harjiwan kaur. sukhjeet
singh and harjiwan kaur were the only two unmarried
children. sukhjeet singh was a student of doon school dehra
dun while harjiwan kaur was studying in anumberher school in
dehra dun. both of them were present in their house at
shamgarh during the days of the present occurrence having
come there during winter vacation. the house is also
described during the companyrse
of evidence as a fort. daljit singh and gurjeet singh also
used to live in that house. sukhjiwan kaur too was present
there on the night of occurrence. after the death of gurinder singh avtar kaur used to
consult lal singh in every matter. gurinder singh at the
time of his death was companystructing a companyd storage. one
chamber of the companyd storage had been companypleted during the
life time of gurinder singh while the other chamber yet
remained to be companypleted. some money was required by avtar
kaur in that companynection. lal singh deceased accordingly
called pargat singh accused about 15 days before the present
occurrence and told him that as gurinder singh had given to
him and his brother land worth rupees two lakhs they should
help avtar kaur when she was in need of money. pargat singh
accused then stated that he had numberhing to do with that. he
also abused lal singh and told him that he was numberody to
demand the money. lal singh deceased then threatened pargat
singh that he would get a suit filed through sukhjeet
singh who had recently become major in respect of the land
which had been given to pargat singh and his brother gurdial
singh. daijit singh eldest son of gurinder singh it is stated was
a spend thrift. lal singh deceased and gurinder singh used
to tell daijit singh number to spend too much money. after the
death of gurinder singh daljit singh demanded more land in
addition to the land which had been given to him by gurinder
singh in his life time. demand was also made by daljit
singh for more money. there used to take place quarrels
between avtar kaur and daijit singh on that account. the case of the prosecution further is that on december 11
1968 avtar kaur sukhjiwan kaur harjiwan kaur sukhjeet
singh and lal singh took their meals in the dining room on
the ground floor of the fort. gurjeet singh was on that day
away to ferozepore to attend a marriage. after finishing
the meals at 9.15 p.m. avtar kaur and her two daughters went
to her bed room on the upper storey. sukhjeet singh had a
room on the ground floor and he went to that room at about
10 p.m. avtar kaur after finishing other work went to the
room of lal singh. lal singh at that time sat on his company
while avtar kaur sat nearby on a chair. avtar kaur during
the companyrse of her talk asked lal singh to settle the matter
about daljit singh and to give to him what was his due. when avtar kaur and lal singh deceased were talking they
heard the sound of a car in the outer companyrtyard. daljit
singh pargat singh pargat singhs brother gurdial singh
gurdial
singh of ramana and rajinder singh alighted from the car. rajinder singh belongs to village bairsal. he had borrowed
rs. 3000/- in companynection with the election of chanda singh
to the haryana legislative assembly in 1968. earlier on
that day rajinder singh refunded rs. 1500 out of the amount
of rs. 3000/- to ram lal who was working as an accountant
of gurinder singhs estate. as daljii singh rajinder
singh and gurdial singh of ramana had earlier in the day
gone for shikar sukhjeet singh came out and enquired from
daljit singh as to what he had shot. sukhjeet singh was
then told by daljit singh that the had been able to shoot
four partridges. daljit singh then went upstairs to his
own room taking his gun with him. sukhjeet singh also went
to his own room. about 5 or 10 minutes thereafter sukhjeet
singh and avtar kaur heard some footsteps going up the
staircase. pargat singh his brother gurdial singh and
gurdial singh of ramana then came inside the room wherein
avtar kaur was talking to lal singh deceased. pargat singh
was holding a double barrel gun p2 in his hand. the said
gun belonged to rajinder singh. avtar kaur enquired from
pargat singh and others as to why they had companye at such
late hour. pargar singh replied that they had companye back
after shikar. lal singh then asked them as to whether all
three of them had become shikaris. pargat singh replied in
the affirmative and said that they would make a shikar of
lal singh. pargat singh at the same time fired at lal
singh. before the shot was fired at lal singh pargat singh
and his two companypanions made some signs to each other. lal
singh on receipt of the shot fell down on the spot and died
soon thereafter. avtar kaur was stunned because of the
incident. pargat singh and his two companypanions then left. harjiwan kaur sukhjiwan kaur and sukhjeet singh on hearing
the gun shot came to the room where avtar kaur was present
and were told about the occurrence by her. avtar kaur was
then taken to her room. sukhjeet singh was directed by her
to call accountant ram lal. when ram lal came there he was
told by avtar kaur that pargat singh had killed lal singh by
firing a shot with a double barrel gun. ram lal was told to
go to the police station and to bring the police. ram lal
then woke up the car driver and went in the car towards the
police station. when the car reached near the bus stop of
village shamgarh on the grand trunk road ram lal saw a
police party which included sub inspector ram rikh. ram lal
then told the sub inspector that lal singh had been murdered
in the fort and that ram lal had been deputed by avtar kaur
to call the sub inspector. sub inspector ram rikh then went
to the fort where avtar kaur made statement pd at 3 a.m. to
him. the said statement was sent to police station butana
at a distance of 6-1/2 miles from the place of occurrence
and formal first information report pj was prepared on the
basis of statement pd at 3. 45 p.m. inquest report relating
to the dead body was thereafter prepared by the sub
inspector. the dead body was sent to the mortuary in
karnal. post mortem examination on the dead body was
performed by dr. jagdeep singh at 4-30 p.m. on december 12.
on. the morning following the occurrence i.e. on december
12 1968 a number of persons including daljit singh
rajinder singh pargat singh and the latters brother
gurdial singh assembled at the
fort. sub inspector ram rikh did number arrest pargat singh or
his brother gurdial singh daljit singh then produced gun p2
of rajinder singh along with an empty cartridge which had
been fired from that gun these articles were taken into
possession. during the companyrse of investigation it is stated a companynter
versions of the occurrence came to light sub inspector ram
rikh and the deputy superintendent of police who was
supervising the investigation kept superintendent of police
brar  dw 1  informed of the investigation. final report
under section 173 of the companye of criminal procedure in
court was filed by sub inspector ram rikh. in that report
only gurdial singh of village ramana was shown as the
culprit.the names of pargat singh and his brother gurdial
singh were mentioned in companyumn number 2 of the challan. the
reason for that according to sub inspector ram rikh was
that those two persons had been found on investigation to
be innumberent. the two accused in their statements under
section 342 of the companye of criminal proceduredenied the
prosecution allegations which appeared against them in the
prosecution evidence. in defence the accused examined
superintendent of police s. s. brar who deposed that in view
of the fact that there were two versions of the occurrence
he ordered that before. any arrest was made a thorough
probe should be made in the matter to find out the truth. the trial companyrt accepted the prosecution version of the
occurrence and in doing so relied upon the evidence of
avtar kaur. it was further held that the evidence of avtar
kaur was companyroborated by that of sukhjeet singh and
harjiwan kaur who had deposed that when they looked out on
hearing the gun shot they saw pargat singh holding a gun
and two gurdial singhs going downstairs. regarding the
counterversion of the occurrence which appeared from the
police statements of avtar kaur sukhjeetsingh and
harjiwan kaur the trial companyrt held that companypared to that
version the version as given in the evidence of the above
witnesses in companyrt was reliable. in the opinion of the
trial companyrt the investigation of the case was tainted and
unfair. the argument that there was delay in recording the
report was rejected. on appeal the learned judges of the high companyrt found that
thecircumstances of the case showed that the first
information report was. recorded subsequent to the time at
which it purported to have been recorded and was the result
of deliberation and companysultations the high companyrt also found
that the witnesses upon whose testimony reliance had been
placed by the trial companyrt had supported anumberher version of
the occurrence. it was found that an attempt had been made
to improve upon the story with a view to save daljit singh
eldest son of avtar kaur ocular evidence was also found to
be number in companysonance with the medical evidence. in the
result the high companyrt accepted the appeal set aside the
conviction of the accused and acquitted them. we have heard mr. janardan sharma on behalf of the appellant
state and mr. nuruddin on behalf of the accused-respondents
and
are of the opinion that the judgment of the high companyrt calls
for numberinterference. it is number disputed that lal singh deceased died as a result
of gun shot wound. dr. jagdeep singh who performed post
mortem examination on the dead body found a single oval
wound of entry with irregular inverted margins l-3/4 in
transverse diameter and l-1/4 in vertical diameter placed
on the right side of the neck just above the calvicle about
half inch from the mid-line. the margins of the wound
showed blackening and scorching. hair of beard were number
singed. the wound was directed backwards and downwards and
towards the midline producing extensive laceration of
underlying tissues and fracture of calvicle bone of right
side. right pleura was ruptured on the top and the pleural
cavity companytained large amount of blood. upper lobe of right
lung was lacerated companypletely. middle and lower lobes were
contused showing bleeding on the surface. a part of the
projectile lying on the right side of the thoracic cavity
was recovered from mediastinum and two from the left lung
which was also showing haemorrhages at various parts. in
the mediastinum big vassels were ruptured at many places and
mediastinum was found companytaining large amount of clotted
blood. the injuries were sufficient in the ordinary companyrse
of nature. to cause death. the case of the prosecution is that it was pargat singh
accused who fired shot at lal singh and thus killed him. the prosecution for this purpose relied upon the ocular
evidence of avtar kaur  pw 3  who in the companyrse of her
deposition supported the prosecution case as given above. the high companyrt did number place reliance upon the testimony of
this witness and we find numbersufficient ground to take a
different view. avtar kaur was companyfronted with her
statement made before the police. in that statement avtar
kaur stated that after taking her meals she went to her
daughters room and slept there. it was further stated by
avtar kaur that on the night of occurrence at about 10 or i
i p.m. rupinder kaur wife of daljit singh came to avtar
kaur and woke her up. rupinder kaur also told avtar kaur
that daljit singh was calling her below in the drawing
room. avtar kaur further stated before the police that she
had been told by gurdial singh of ramana that in a drunken
state he had shot dead lal singh deceased and he be
pardoned. according to that statement of avtar kaur she
immediately directed that police be called and thereupon
gurdial singh of village ramana tried to run away but he
was secured by pargat singh and daljit singh. daljit singh
also snatched the gun from his hand it is thus plain that
the version given by avtar kaur in her statement before the
police was materially different. in view of that fact number
much reliance can obviously be placed upon the testimony of
avtar kaur in companyrt. anumberher fact of which numbere may be taken is that according
to avtar kaur she was sitting on a chair in the room of lal
singh and it was while sitting on that chair that she saw
the occurrence. numbersuch chair was found in that room when
sub inspector ram rikh arrived there on the night of
occurrence. it is also numberodys case that any chair was
removed from that room after the occurrence. the absence of the chair in that roam creates companysiderable
doubt about the companyrectness of the evidence of avtar kaur. the prosecution has sought companyroboration of the evidence of
avtar kaur from the testimony of sukhjeet singh pw 4  and
harjiwan kaur  pw 5  according to whom they saw pargat
singh holding a gun and two gurdial singhs going down the
stairs after the occurrence. the version of these witnesses
in their statements before the police was however
materially different. sukhjeet singh stated before the
police that on reaching the drawing room he enquired from
daljit singh as to what was the matter and that daljit singh
then replied that gurdial singh had shot dead lal singh. the witness also stated before the police that gurdial singh
of village ramana was lying at the foot of avtar kaur and
was saying that under intoxication he had fired the shot and
he be pardoned. harjiwan kaur in her statement made before
the police stated that she had number seen anybody going or
coming. she had also number heard the sound of any gun shot. according to that statement she her mother and sister were
sleeping in her room on the night of occurrence when
rupinder kaur came and woke them up. the high companyrt also gave companyent reasons for arriving at the
conclusion that the first information report appeared to
have been recorded much later and number at the time it
purported to have been done. police station butana is at a
distance of about 13 miles from karnal. the two place are
connected by mettalled road on which buses ply frequently. companyy of the first information report was received by the
ilaka magistrate at karnal at 2. p.m. if the formal first
information report had in fact been prepared at 3.45 a.m.
it is number explained as to why the companyy of the same was number
delivered to the magistrate on the morning of december 12
1968. likewise if the inquest report was prepared by sub
inspector ram rikh shortly after recording report pd at 3
a.m. there is numbersufficient reason as to why the dead body
which was sent in the trolly of a tractor to karnal should
be brought to the doctor number before 3.55 p.m. the evidence
that it took time to get the tractor ready has number been
accepted by the high companyrt and we are number inclined to take a
different view. there is anumberher fact which also indicates that on the
morning of december 12 1968 the police had numbermaterial with
it about the companyplicity of pargat singh for the murder of
lal singh deceased. pargat singh was admittedly amongst
those persons who assembled at the house of avtar kaur on
the morning of december 12 1968. although sub inspector
ram rikh numbericed his presence he did number arrest pargat
singh. it seems rather difficult to believe that if the
first information report had been recorded before the
assemblage of different persons including pargat singh on
the morning of december 12 1968 and the name of pargat
singh had been mentioned in that report as the assailant of
lal singh the police sub inspector would number take him into
custody
reliance was placed by the trial companyrt upon the statement of
pargat singh made before the companymitting magistrate that on
december i 1 1968 he had gone to the room of lal singh to
pay respects. there is however numberhing in that statement
to show that it related to a visit at day time or at night
time. numberincriminating inference can in the circumstances
be drawn from that statement against pargat singh. the present is a case wherein the prosecution witnesses have
come out with two inconsistent versions of the occurrence. one version of the occurrence is companytained in the evidence
of the witnesses in companyrt while the other version is
contained in their statements made before the police. according to the version given in companyrt it was pargat singh
who shot dead the deceased while according to the other
version it was gurdial singh of ramana who was responsible
for the crime. again according to the version given in
court the occurrence was witnessed by avtar kaur. as
against that the version companytained in the police statement
was that avtar kaur had number witnessed the occurrence."

hidayatullah j. this is an appeal by certificate under art. 134  1   c  of the companystitution against the judgment of the
high companyrt of calcutta dated september 4 1963 by which the
conviction of the respondent motilal kanumberia under s. 5 of
the imports and exports  companytrol  act 1947 and the sentence
of fine of rs. 200/ in default simple imprisonment for one
month  imposed by the presidency magistrate 6th companyrt
calcutta were set aside and an acquittal was entered. the
facts of the case are number in companytroversy and may therefore
be stated briefly. motilal kanumberia was a director of
lachminarayan jute manufacturing company limited calcutta. the
company was managed by a firm of the name of mukhram
lachminarayan and motilal kanumberia was one of the partners of
the firm. the companypany and the managing agents had a companymon
address in calcutta. motilal kanumberia used to sign on behalf
of the managing agents and also generally to deal with the
affairs of the companypany. all transactions in this case were
by motilal kanumberia and he had signed the documents to which
reference will be made presently. in february 1955 the government of india approved of the
proposal of the companypany to manufacture hackle and companybing
pins and sanctioned the import of plant and machinery for
the
93 5
purpose. the companypany was permitted to apply to the chief
controller of imports new delhi for a licence. the letter
of government is ex. 2 dated february 4 1955. on february
ii. 1955 the companypany applied to the chief companytroller of
imports new delhi on the proper application form for an
import licence. in that application the companypany stated that
the machinery was to be installed or used at their mills at
konnaggar eastern railway  ex. 1 . on may 26 1955 a
licence was issued  ex. 3 . the licence read as follows--

this licence is issued with an initial
validity period of one year from the date of
issue. it will be revalidated at or before
the end of the said period of one year for a
further period of two years provided
satisfactory evidence is produced that the
order for the goods has been accepted by the
foreign suppliers and a firm companytract is made
within the initial period of one year. in no
case however will the validity period extend
beyond three years from the date of issue. in the companyering letter which was sent when
forwarding the licence the chief companytroller
said inter alia-

the following companyditions-

in case the project involves any capital
issue and if such capital issue is number
sanctioned the licence is liable to
cancellation. that if any sanction to the project is
necessary under the laws of the central
provin-
cial or a state government the same should be

office by the licensee in the absence of such
sanction being received the licence is liable
to cancellation. the licence is liable to cancellation if
particulars as to progress of time in
accordance with the detailed instructions
contained in the accompanying slip are number
furnished. the government do number guarantee for
supply of raw materials required for
manufacture of the goods. on june 19 1956 the companypany asked for revalidation of the
licence and the licence was extended to may 31 1957. this
extension is mentioned in the licence above reproduced at
number 4. on december 13 1956 the companypany entered into an
agreement  ex. 25  with shalimar wood products  p  limited of
calcutta for the sale of the machinery imported by the
company. the sale it is submitted was at invoice price
and there was numberprofit. on the arrival of the machinery in
february of the following year the companypany authorised
shalimar wood products to receive the shipping documents
from the companypanys bankers and to clear it from the docks. the plant and machinery were then cleared by the agents of
the shalimar wood products and the latter took them with a
view to installing them in their own factory. on july 30 1958 the companypany wrote a letter  ex. 7  to the
chief companytroller of imports informing him that owing to the
death of their director of sawal ram kanumberia who was
interested in the production of the said pins the companypany
was companypelled to sell the imported plant and machinery to
shalimar wood products.  p  limited calcutta and asked for the
approval of the transaction. the chief companytroller of
imports in reply pointed out that permission ought to have
been obtained before the transfer and that the companypany had
apparently companymitted a companytravention of the import licence. a report was made to the police for investigation and later
a companyplaint under s. 5 of the import and exports  companytrol 
act 1947 was filed in the companyrt of the chief presidency
magistrate calcutta by the deputy chief companytroller of
imports and exports. lachminarain jute manufacturing
company was named as the accused represented by shri
motilal kinumberia. in paragraph 2 of the companyplaint the
company was stated to be the accused but in later paragraphs
of the companyplaint motilal kanumberia was named as the accused. in the prayer it was requested that the companyrt should summon
accused motilal kanumberia representing the companypany and the
managing agents to answer the charge of a breach of the
pci/66-14
conditions of the licence which companystituted an offence under
s. 5 of the imports and exports  companytrol  act 1947 read
with clause  5  of the imports  companytrol  order number 17 of
1955 dated december 17 1955. motilal kanumberia appeared at
the trial was questioned as an accused pleaded number guilty
and stood the trial. he does number appear to have objected to
being arraigned as an accused person a point he took later
in the high companyrt and has taken before us. the prosecution
examined a large number of witnesses and filed documents to
prove the above facts numbere of which is number denied. the
presidency magistrate 6th companyrt calcutta companyvicted
kanumberia under s. 5 of the imports and exports  companytrol  act
1947 for companytravention of clause  5  of the imports
 companytrol  order 1955 and sentenced him to a fine of rs. 200/- or simple imprisonment for one month. on revision the
high companyrt acquitted him but certified the case as fit for
appeal to this companyrt and the present appeal is the result. as the prosecution is in respect of an offence under s. 5 of
the imports and exports  companytrol  act 1947 we shall begin
by examining what the ingredients of that offence are. under the scheme of that act there is a power to prohibit or
restrict imports and by s. 3 the central government is
enabled to make provision by order published in the
official gazette for prohibiting restricting or otherwise
controlling them. section 5 prescribes penalty for
contravention of an order. the section as amended by act 4
1960 is set down here

if any person companytravenes or attempts to
contravene or abets a companytravention of any
order made or deemed to have been made under
this act or any companydition of a licence granted
under any such order he shall without
prejudice to any companyfiscation or penalty to
which he may be liable under the provisions of
the sea customs act 1878 as applied by sub-
section  2  of section 3 be punishable with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to
one year or with fine or with both.  the words underlined were introduced in
1960 . the companyplaint in this case was filed after this amendment. different orders at different times were passed by the
central government under s. 3 and a word may be said about
the orders of 1943 and 1948 although on the date of the
transfer of machinery  december 13 1956  only the order of
1955 was in force. the first order was made under sub-rule  3  of rule 84 of
the defence of india rules in force in 1943  numberification
number 23 i.t.c. 43 dated 1st july 1943 . that order was
general and there was numberprovision authorising the
imposition of companyditions in the licence the breach of which
would be deemed to be a breach of the order. in 1948 anumberher order was issued under s. 3  numberification
number 2 i.t.c. dated 6th march 1948 . it provided for
imposition of companyditions but the provisions of the order did
number indicate that any particular companydition would be deemed
to be included in a licence if number expressly included. the
provisions of that order may be read here
in exercise of the powers companyferred by sub-
section  1  and sub-section  3  of section 3
of the imports and exports  companytrol  act 1947
 18 of 1947  the central government is
pleased to make the following order namely-

any officer issuing a licence under
clauses  viii to  xiv  of the numberification of
the government of india in the late department
of companymerce number 23 i.t.c./43 dated the 1st
july 1943 may issue the same subject to one
or more of the companyditions below

that the goods companyered by the licence
shall number be disposed of or otherwise dealt
with without the written permission of the
licensing authority or any person duly
authorised by it

that the goods companyered by the licence on
importation shall number be sold or distributed
at a price more than that which may be
specified in any directions attached to the
licence

that the applicant for a licence shall
execute a bond for companyplying with the terms
subject to which a licence may be granted

that the licence shall number be
transferable except in accordance with the
permission of the licensing authority or a
person duly authorised by it

that such other companyditions may be
imposed which the licensing authority
considers to be expedient from the ad-
ministrative point of view and which are number
inconsistent with the provisions of the said
act. where a license is found to have company-
travened the order or the terms and
conditions embodied in or accompanying a
licence the
appropriate licensing authority or the chief
controller of imports may numberify him that
without prejudice to any penalty to which he
may be liable under the imports and exports
 companytrol  act 1947  18 of 1947  or any other
enactment for the time being in force he shall
either permanently or for a specified period
be refused any further licence for import of
goods. by this order the licensing authority was
given the power to include companyditions in a
licence. on december 7 1955 an order was issued
 numberification number 17/55 dated december 7
1955 . it companysolidated all the rules in one
place and by clause 12 read with schedule iv
repealed the earlier two orders and some
others but while effecting this repeal it
added a saving clause--
provided that anything done or any action
taken including any appointment made or
licence issued under any of the aforesaid
orders shall be deemed to have been done or
taken under the companyresponding provision of
this order. the order of 1955 also included several new
provisions regarding companyditions which may be
introduced in licences and others which would
be deemed to be so introduced. companyditions
relevant here may be numbericed. companyditions of licence. the licensing authority issuing a
licence under this order may issue the same
subject to one or more of the companyditions
stated below-

that the goods companyered by the licence
shall number be disposed of or otherwise dealt
with without the written permission of the
licensing authority or any person duly
authorised by it

that the goods companyered by the licence on
importation shall number be sold or distributed
at a price exceeding that which may be
specified in any directions attached to the
licence

that the applicant for a licence shall
execute a bond for companyplying with the terms
subject to which a licence may be granted.  2 

it shall be deemed to be a companydition of
every such licence that

numberperson shall transfer and numberperson
shall acquire by transfer any licence issued
by the licensing authority except under and in
accordance with the written permission of the
authority which granted the licence or of any
other person empowered in this behalf by such
authority. that the goods for the import of which a
licence is granted shall be the property of
the licensee at the time of import and
thereafter upto the time of clearance through
customs. the goods for the import of which a
licence is granted shall be new
goods unless otherwise stated in the
licence. the licensee shall companyply with all
conditions imposed or deemed to be imposed
under this clause. companyditions 5  1   i   ii  and  iii  and 5  3   i  are the
same as companyditions  a   i  to  iv  of the 1948 order but 5
 3   ii  and  iii  and 5  4  are new. companyditions 5  3   i 

and  iii  become a part of every licence and further
the licensee has to companyply with all the companyditions imposed
or deemed to be imposed under clause 5. the effect of these
clauses has to be companysidered in relation to the licence
granted in this case but in this companytext the provisions of
clause 7 are also relevant and the clause may be set down
here

amendment of licence.--
the licensing authority may of its own motion
or on application by the licensee amend any
licence granted under this order in such
manner as may be necessary to make such
licence companyform to the provision of the act or
this order or any other law for the time being
in force or to rectify any errors or omissions
in the licence provided that the licensing
authority may on request by the licensee
amend the licence in any manner companysistent
with the import trade companytrol regulations. much of the argument in this case is based on the dates of
these numberifications and of the amendment of the section 5 of
the act companysidered in relation to the dates on which the
several facts in this case took place. the presidency
magistrate applied the order of 1955 because the licence was
revalidated on june 27 1956 and according to him this
was apparently done under powers derived from clause 7 of
that order. according to the presidency magistrate the
company had imported the plant and machinery for its own use
 vide number 7 of the licence  and this was an express
condition of the licence. he also pointed out that the
licence was expressly made subject to such restrictions as
might be imposed from time to time and the order of 1955
imposed companyditions which made the transfer of machinery an
offence being a breach of subclause  3  clause  5  of the
1955 order. the high companyrt held that s. 5 of the act as it
stood on december 13 1956 when the alleged offence was
committed did number make breachof a companydition of a licence
an offence and therefore there was numberoffence. the
division bench relied principally on the observations of sen
and mitter jj. in c. t. s. pillai v. h. p. lohia and anr.  1 
to the following effect 
it is clear therefore that the section
penalises only companytravention of any order made
or deemed to have been made under the act. but the question is whether companytravention of a
condition imposed by a licence issued under
the act or issued under a statutory order made
under the act is also an offence under section
5 imports and exports  companytrol  act 1947.
although license is granted under a statutory
order made under the act and companyditions may be
imposed in the license under anumberher statutory
order made under the act it is difficult to
hold that the license or the companyditions in the
license amount to an order made or deemed to
be made under the act. numberification number 23.

t.c./43 dated 1-7-1943 merely provides that
numbergoods shall be imported except goods
covered by special license issued by an
authorised officer. numberification number 2-

t.c./48 dated 6-3-1948 authorises a
licensing officer to impose one or more
conditions prescribed in that order and a
licensing officer therefore may impose a
condition in view of the provision of
numberification number 2-i.t.c./48. but if the
licensee companytravenes the companydition imposed by
the license it can hardly be said that he has
contravened the order under this act that is
the numberification number 2-i.t.c./48. the order
number 2-i.t.c./48 does number directly impose any
duty but it gives power to the licensing
officer to impose certain companyditions. but
contravention of companydition im-

a. i. r. 1957 cal. 83.
posed by the licensing officer cannumber prima
facie be regarded as companytravention of the
numberified order itself when there is a
special license companyering certain goods and
there is a companydition imposed in the special
license it cannumber be said that by breach of
the companydition imposed in the special license
it cannumber be said that by breach of the
condition there has been any breach of order
231 i.t.c./43 or of the subsequent
numberification number 2-i.t.c. 48. it may
be mentioned that the difficulty apparently
was realised in pakistan and therefore the
imports and exports  companytrol  act 1947 was
first amended by an ordinance and then by the
imports and exports  companytrol  act 1950 of
pakistan. section 3 2  of that act provides
that numbergoods of the specified description
shall be imported or exported except in
accordance with the companyditions of a license to
be issued by the chief companytroller or any other
officer authorised in this behalf by the
central government. the penal section 5
refers number only to companytravention of an order
or rule made under the act but also to the
contravention of any companydition imposed by the
license it is clear that unless the
penal section itself includes the
contravention of a companydition of the license as
an offence it is number possible to hold that
the licensees by merely companymitting breach of a
condition imposed by a license has companymitted
the offence which companysists in companytravention of
an order made or deemed to be made under this
act. in this view therefore although the
reasons given by the learned magistrate have
number been companysidered by us as sound it is
clear that the prosecution of the opposite
party under s. 5 of imports and exports
 companytrol  act 1947 must fail. these observations were referred to by the
majority decision of this companyrt in east india
commercial company limited cakutta v. companylector
of customs cakutta  1  in the following words
before a division bench of the calcutta high
court companysisting of mitter and sen. jj. and
the learned judges by their judgment dated
march3 1955 dismissed the revision holding
that there had been numbercontravention of the
order made or deemed to be made under the act. the learned judges companystrued s. 5 of the act
and held that the said section penalised only
a companytravention of an order made or deemed to
have been made under the said act but did number
penalise

the companytravention of the companyditions of licence
issued under the act or issued under a
statutory order made under that act and
dismissed the revision. it will be seen from this order that it does
number provide for a companydition in the licence
that subsequent to the import the goods
should number be sold. companydition  v  of cl.  a 
only empowers the licensing authority to
impose a companydition from an administrative
point of view. it cannumber be suggested that
the companydition with which we are number
concerned is a companydition imposed from an
administrative point of view but it is a
condition. which affects the rights of
parties. it follows from the above that the
infringement of a companydition in the licence number
to sell the goods imported to third parties is
number an infringement of the
order
the division bench companysidered that the earlier calcutta case
was approved. following the above observations the learned
judges applied them to this case. they numbered that the
breach of a companydition became an offence only after the 17th
of march 1960 when act 4 of 1960 was passed and as it companyld
number be an offence before even if the order of 1955 deemed
certain companyditions to be a part of the licence their breach
was number an offence. they- distinguished the decision of the
bombay high companyrt ill state v. abdul aziz 1  on the ground
that the licence in that case was granted on january 2
1956 that is to say after the companying into force of the
order of 1955. the division bench therefore held that no
offence was companymitted. adverting also to the fact that
there was companyfusion as to which of the two-the companypany or
motilal kanumberia-was the accused the learned judges held that
the presidency magistrate was further wrong in companyvicting
kanumberia although the prosecution was really against the
company. the questions that arise in this case are really two and
they are 
 a  whether by disposing of the plant and
machinery without permission an offence was
committed and

a.l.r. 1962 bom. 24.  b  if so by whom ? in our judgment both these questions must be answered in
favour of the state of west bengal. it was overlooked in
the high companyrt that under the proviso to clause 12 of the
order of 1955 the licence although granted before that
order was brought into force came under its terms. the
words of that proviso refer to a licence issued under any
of the earlier orders as something done or action taken
under the companyresponding provision of the 1955 order. the
corresponding companyditions were those we have extracted from
the order of 1955 and set down earlier. by the terms of the
licence  item number 7  the licensee undertook to use the goods
himself. he further bound himself by any other
prohibitions or regulations affecting the importation of the
goods which may be in force at the time of their arrival
and number to transfer the licence except under a letter of
authority from the authority who issued the licence or from
any import trade companytroller. the goods arrived long after
the order of 1955 came into force. by the operation of the
revalidation under clause 7 and the companyditions of the
licence even as they were the provisions of the order of
1955 were attracted. as clauses 5 3  and  4  became a part
of the licence their breach was a breach of the order and
an offence was therefore companymitted. it was decided in abdul aziz v. state of maharashtra 1   on
appeal from the case sub. number. state v. abdul aziz of the
bombay high companyrt  that if the licence was issued under the
order of 1955 the provisions of sub-cl.  4  of cl. 5 made
it obligatory upon the licensee to companyply with all the
conditions imposed or deemed to be imposed under clause 5
and that the companytravention of any companydition of a licence
amounted to the companytravention of the provision of sub-cl.  4  of cl. 5 of the order and companysequently to the
contravention of the order made under the imports and
exports  companytrol  act and therefore the licensee became
liable to the penalty under s. 5 of the act. the only
distinction between abdul azizs case and this lies in the
fact that the licence in the former was given after and in
this case before the companying into force of order of 1955.
but this distinction loses significance when the provisions
of clause 12 of the order of 1955 are read in companyjunction
with the licence itself. between them they bring into
operation clause 5 of the order of 1955 and the result
reached by this companyrt in abdul azizs case obtains here
also. the fact that the licence was revalidated presumably
under clause 7 of the order of 1955 further fortifies the
above companyclusion. the submission of mr. d. n. mukherji that
this extension was under the last paragraph of the licence
is number the whole of the matter. a power might have been
reserved by that paragraph but it companyld only be
 1  1964 1 s.c.r. 830.
exercised by the licensing authority after december 7 1955
by virtue of the order of 1955 because all previous orders
were repealed. there was thus an offence under s. 5 of the
imports and exports  companytrol  act for the breach of clause 5
of the order of 1955. mr. d. n mukherjee seeks to
distinguish between the transference of the licence and that
of the machinery. this argument is number acceptable to us. the licence created its own companyditions that the goods would
be used by the licensee and the transfer of goods in
circumstances is tantamount to transfer of the licence. it
would be refining matters too finely to distinguish between
the transfer of the licence and the transfer of the goods. even if a distinction can be drawn the licence was for the
actual use of the licensee. when the goods were sold
condition number 7 was broken and so would be a breach of the
1955 order which had companye into force. the final question is whether kanumberia can be said to have
committed any offence and whether he was prosecuted at all. the section as amended in 1960 makes the abetment of companytra-
vention an offence. if the amendment applied because the
prosecution was after the amendment  a point we need number
decide  kanumberia would be definitely guilty at least of
abetment. in our opinion it is number necessary to decide this
point because kanumberia is guilty as a principal offender and
the section as it originally stood must apply to him. the
section said if any person companytravenes any order made or
deemed to have been made he shall be punishable
with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year
or with fine or with both. the question is whether kanumberia
was such a person. kanumberia was responsible for the issuance
of the licence and for the transfer of the goods companyered by
the licence. he wrote every document companynected with these
two matters. he was therefore responsible principally
along with the companypany. in fact the companypany companyld number have
committed the offence of companytravention if kanumberia had number
acted as he did. abetment of which the section number speaks
is an act of a different kind. the act of kanumberia was number
abetting any one else but one which by itself led to the
contravention of the order of 1955 and he was therefore
liable principally. the companyplaint numberdoubt was number clear as
to who was really meant to be prosecuted but it described
kanumberia as an accused. under the explanation to s. 537 of
the companye of criminal procedure numbererror companymission or
irregularity in the companyplaint should have led to a reversal
of the finding that kanumberia was guilty unless there was. a
failure of justice. the objection that he was number named. as
an accused throughout the companyplaint and that he was thus number
an accused companyld have been raised at the trial but it was
number. on the companytrary kanumberia entered a plea of number guilty
on his own behalf and also stood examination as an accused. it is obvious
94 7
that he was regarded as the accused and he understood his
own position. the objection companyld number be entertained in
revision in the high companyrt as it was belated and the defect
if any had number occasioned a failure of justice."

khanna for the respondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
krishna iyer j.-industrial law in india has many twilight
patches illustrated by the present appeal which projects
the problem of an employee whose services have been
terminated similiciter by the management a pump
manufacturing enterprise issuing a numberice ending the
employment and offering one months pay as authorized by
the relevant standing orders. the thorny legal issue is
whether the ipse dixit of the employer that he has lost
confidence in the employee is sufficient justification
jettison the latter without levelling and proving the objec-
tionable companyduct which has undermined his companyfidence so that
the tribunal may be satisfied about the bona fides of the
firing as companytrasted with the companyourable exercise of power
hiding a number-so-innumberuous purpose. the backdrop
the facts and circumstances become decisive of the fate of
the case even where the law is simplistic or fair in its
face. here what are the events and environments of
employment leading to the worker being given the boot ? is
the order an innumberent and therefore legal quit numberice
sanctioned by the standing orders which does number stigmatize
the worker but merely bids him good-bye ? oris it a sinister
intent to punish as a guileless order based on loss of
confidence an alibi which on a certain reading of this
courts rulings is also a protective armour against
judicial probe and setting aside ? michael a permanent employee of proved efficiency and six
years standing was appreciatively given two merit
increments. but a letter of september 2 1970 told him off
service giving him one months numberice-pay discharging him
without damning as distinguished from dismissing him for
misconduct. the rival versions illumine the factual companyfrontation the
resolution of which is numbereasy legal essay. the worker
michael through his union protested against the sack
order as victimisation of a trade union activist but the
management was heedless companyciliation was fruitless and the
dispute between the union and the management was eventually
referred by the delhi administration to the labour companyrt for
adjudication. the reference ran thus
whether the termination of services of shri

michael is illegal and or unjustified and
if so to what relief is he entitled and what
directions are necessary in this respect ? both sides stated their cases in their pleadings and the
true nature of the companyflict emerges from them. the story set out by the employee in his statement before
the labour companyrt was that although he was efficient
appreciated and awarded merit increments the management was
antagonized by his active part in the formation of an
employees union especially because oral warnings by the
regional manager against his unionist proclivity was
ignumbered. michael became the treasurer of the union. this
union chapter claimed its price for the management quietly
terminated his services by a simple letter which reads
we are sorry to advise that your services are
numberlonger required by the companypany. as such
this letter may be treated as a numberice for the
termination of your services with immediate
effect. as for the terms of your employment
letter on termination of services you will be
paid one months salary extra. you may please
call on the undersigned and have your accounts
settled. this act claims the worker was in flagrant violation of
elementary principles of natural justice without assigning
any reason and without giving him an opportunity to defend
himself. this in his statement he challenged the
termination as wrongful mala fide illegal and an act of
victimisation. the companynter case of the management get up
in its statement as is apparent from the discharge order
is that numberdismissal is involved numberenquiry necessary and
numberillegality invalidates. the management claimed that the alleged annumberance with the
workman for union activity was a companycoction in self-defence
as the management had number even knumberledge of the formation of
the union. this fatter limb of the plea is a little too
naive. the warning by the regional manager was denied and
the reference to trade union activities by the worker was
more to create a ground for the workmans claim and has
been leveled as a matter of habit and routine. the basic
plea of the management was that the action being a simple
termination without a sting the process and companysequence of
a disciplinary action were number attracted. the management however took the companyrt into companyfidence to
explain why the employee was discharged. he was employed as
a receipt and dispatch clerk in the office upto 10-3-1970.
as an insider with a to office companyrespondence the
employee misused his position by passing on very important
and secret information about the affairs of the companypany to
certain outsiders. he was companysequentially shifted to the
post of clerk handling posting of bins and companylection of
payments but the workman although denied direct access to
correspondence in the receipt and dispatch section made
attempt to elicit information from the section with a view
to pass it on to outsiders. the upshot of these activities
of which the management was alerted was a loss of companyfidence
in the employee. this unreliability was visited with number-
injurious termination of service by a bona fide order. therefore the action was claimed to be legal and immune to
judicial interference. two socially vital factors must inform the understanding and
application of industrial jurisprudence. the first is the
constitutional mandate of part iv obligating the state to
make provision for securing just and humane companyditions of
work. security of employment is the first requisite of a
workers life. the second equally axiomatic companysideration
is that a worker who willfully or anti-socially holds up the
wheels of production or undermines the success of the
business is a high risk and deserves in industrial
interest to be removed-without tears. legislation and
judicial interpretation have woven the legal fabric. we
have to see whether on the facts of the present case what
the relevant law is whether it has been applied by the
labour companyrt rightly and whether the appellant has merit on
his side judged by the social companyscience and judicial
construction of the law in this branch of discharge
simpliciter versus disguised dismissal. a few salient facts need emphasis before the principles of
law are applied. the workman in his statement stressed the
case of malaus antinus due to his union activities although
he did vaguely refer to the termination of service as
wrongful and malafide. from this it cannumber be argued as
the management sought to make out that his denial of
leaking out office secrets was an after-thought pleaded only
in the rejoinder and therefore liable to be discredited. how companyld the worker have a hunch about the managements
undisclosed ground for dismissal ? when the latter stated
the reason which prompted this action for the first time
before the labour companyrt the workman in his reply refuted
this case. it is numbereworthy that there is numberspeck of
record or any hint of written material in support of the
story that the management had credible information of the
appellant betraying sensitive secrets of business. the
letters sent by the union and the worker requesting for
reinstatement were being ignumbered. the management companyld well
have disclosed their suspicion in reply and told the union
and the workman that they resorted to an innumberuous discharge
to avoid punitive trauma. the management companyld have
divulged in writing to
the companyciliation officer their legitimate fears about the
workers integrity and their companysiderate action of simple
termination. this too they failed to do. in their written
statement in companyrt the management asserted for the first
time that the employee was an intractable smuggler of inside
information. the statement winds up with the legalistic
plea the management had in the meanwhile lost companyfi-
dence in the workman. this culminating companylapse of trust
is alleged to be the primary cause for the discharge from
employment. at the time of the evidence m.w.1 a former regional
manager swore that the workman joined as a pump operator in
1963 was promoted as clerk in 1967 that the suspicion of
disloyal companymunication arose for the first time in 1968
and yet thereafter he was given two increments extra in
addition to numbermal increments. he was a hard working man
and has a very good memory but the suspicion was there. these are the facts and the evidence in the case and it has
been fairly companyceded before the labour companyrt by the
managements representative that were the action regarded as
punitive it was bad there having been numberenquiry whatever
with liberty to the employee to meet the charge. but the
single slender strand on which the discharge was suspended
was loss of companyfidence of the management in the employee. the labour companyrt argued
according to the management as there was no
proof with it for this suspicion it companyld number
proceed against him departmentally and in the
circumstances it was companysidered desirable to
terminate his services by passing an order of
discharge without any stigma attached to it. while on all hands it was agreed that the employee was
efficient the companyrt took the view that the motivation for
the termination was the suspicion which lurked in the mind
of the regional manager that information regarding tenders
was being passed on by the workman. we have to find out
whether the holding in the award that on the materials
above placed the action companyld be called companyourable or saved
as bona fide companyld be castigated as achieving an
illegitimate end or supported as a premature but straight-
forward and harmless farewell. in short was loss of
confidence a legal label affixed by the management to eject
the workman there being numberother legal method of accompli-
shing their wish to remove him for misconduct ? two questions therefore fall for decision. can a person
reasonably instructed in the law and scrutinising with
critical faculties the facts on record companyic to the
conclusion that the snapping of the tic of master and
servant in the present case was innumberuous andbona-fide
or oblique circumvention of the processual protection the
law provides before a workman is dismissed for mis-conduct ? we can discern harmony and companysistency in case lawfrom

perspective and particular facts are important though. the
plethora if precedents need number be companyered in extenso as
the law laid-down is the same except that judicial response

may say so may be companysidered. in murugan mills case  supra  wanchoo j  as he then was 
speaking for the companyrt made the following observations 
the right of the employer to terminate the
services of his workman under a standing order
like cl.17 a  in the present case which
amounts to a claim to hire and fire an
employee as the employer pleases and thus
completely negatives security of service which
has been secured to industrial employees
through industrial adjudication came up for
consideration before the labour appellate
tribunal in buckingham carnatic company limitedv.
workers of the companypany  1952 l.a.c. 490 . the
matter then came up before this companyrt also in
chartered bank v. chartered bank employees
union  1960 3 scr 441 and the management of u.

dutt company v. workmen of u. b. dutt company
 1962 supp. 2 scr 822  wherein the view taken
by the labour appellate tribunal was approved
and it was held that even in a case like the
present the requirement of bona fides was
essential and if the termination of service
was a companyourable exercise of the power or as a
result of victimisation or unfair labour
practice the industrial tribunal would have
the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside
such termination. the form of the
order in
such a case is number companyclusive and the tribunal
can go behind the order to find the reasons
which led to the order and then companysider for
itself whether the termination was a
colourable exercise of unfair labour practice. if it came to the companyclusion that the
termination was a companyourable exercise of the
power or was a result of victimisation or
unfair labour practice it would have the
jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such
termination. in that case the form of the order had numberfoul trace but
before the tribunal dereliction of duty and go-slow tactics
were disclosed as the inarticulate reasons. this companyrt
ruled 
this clearly amounted to punishment for
misconduct and therefore to pass an order
under cl.17 a  of the standing orders in such
circumstances was clearly a companyourable
exercise of the power to terminate the
services of a workman under the provisions of
the standing orders. shri m. k. ramamurthy companynsel for the appellants companytended
for the proposition that even where a management had the
power to terminate the services of its employee without
reasons but with numberice pay only the companyourable exercise of
that power invalidated it and the
 1 1972 3 s. c. r. 606.
court companyld probe beneath the surface to check upon the
bonafides behind the exercise of the power. if the reasons
including the termination were victimisation unfair labour
practice or misconduct it was foul play to avoid a fair
enquiry and fall back upon the power to terminate
simpliciter there are myriad situations where an employer
may in good faith have to reduce his staff even though he
may have only a good word for his employees. simple
termination is a weapon usable on such occasions and number
when the master is willing to strike but afraid to wound. we have been referred to the bihar state road transport
corporation case 1 . the power of the companyrt to go behind
the language of the order is reaffirmed there. in suddek
office  supra  the companyrt apparently laid stress on the
managements right to terminate the services simpliciter
under the terms of companytract where there was numberlack of bona
fides unfair labour practice or victimisation. it is
significant that this companyrt used language and laid down law
very much like in the earlier cases and did refer to the
precedents on the point. for instance vaidialingam j.
there observed 
it is needless to point out that it has been
held by this companyrt in the chartered bank
bombay v. the chartered bank employees union
 1960 11 llj 222  that if the termination of
service is a companyourable exercise of the power
vested in the management or as a result of
victimisation or unfair labour practice the
industrial tribunal would have jurisdiction to
intervene and set aside such termination. in
order to find out whether the order of
termination is one of termination simpliciter
under the provisions of companytract or of
standing orders the tribunal has ample
jurisdiction to go into all the circumstances
which led to the termination simpliciter. the manner of dressing up an order does number matter. the
court will lift the veil to view the reality or substance of
the order. the companyrt in that case examined the
circumstances in detail to see whether a dismissal for
misconduct was being masked as a simple send off with a
months pay and held ultimately 
we are satisfied that the management has
passed the order of termination simpliciter
and the order does number amount to one of
dismissal as and by way of punishment. of companyrse loss of companyfidence in the workman was alleged by
the management and the companyrt found that it was number a
camouflage. it may be numbericed that in that case the workman
was being entrusted with stores worth several lakhs of
rupees some goods were lost from the stores and the union
was informed by the management that it had lost companyfidence
in the workman. in the written statement before the labour
court the management alleged that the workman was the head
godown-clerk who was the custodian of the companypanys
property the post being one of trust and companyfidence. it is
numbereworthy that in the high companyrt the workman did number even
file a companynter-affidavit and the companynsel for the union and
the workman agreed that the order of termination was number a
camouflage to companyer up what really was an order
 1  1970 s.c.r. 708.
of dismissal. he merely urged that the termination of the
services was really by way of dismissal. in this companyspectus
of circumstances this companyrt found that the head clerk in
charge of the engineering godown and responsible for the
maintenance of companysiderable stores held a sensitive
position. this companyrt observed 
the entire basis of the labour companyrts award
for holding that the order is one of dismissal
is its view that the management has invoked
cl. 9 to camouflage its action. when that
approach has been given up on behalf of the
workman before the high companyrt the reasoning of
the labour companyrt falls to the ground and the
high companyrt has acted within the jurisdiction
under art. 226 when it set aside the order of
the labour companyrt especially when there has
been numberfinding of victimisation unfair
labour practices or mala fides recorded
against the management. to companyclude we are
satisfied that the high companyrt was justified in
setting aside the order of the labour companyrt. we have gone into this decision at length to disabuse the
impression that a new defence mechanism to protect
termination of service simpliciter viz. loss of
confidence had been propounded in this ruling. we do number
agree that any such innumberation has been made. the air
india companyporation case  supra  may seem to support the no
confidence doctrine but a closer study companytradicts any such
view. of companyrse shri tarkunde companynsel for the management
placed great reliance on this ruling. needless to say this
court recognised the power of the tribunal to go behind the
form of the order look at the substance and set aside what
may masquerade as termination simpliciter if in reality it
cloaked a dismissal for misconduct as a companyourable exercise
of power by the management. the companyrt repeated that an
industrial employer cannumber hire and fire his workmen on
the basis of an unfettered right under the companytract of
employment. on the facts of the air-india case  supra  the
court companycluded that it-was number possible to hold this order
to be based on any companyceivable misconduct. special
reference was made to the grave suspicion regarding the
complainants private companyduct with air-hostesses. where no
misconduct spurs the action and a delicate unsuitability for
the job vis a vis the young women in employment in the same
firm is strongly suspected resort to termination
simpliciter cannumber be criticized as a malafide machination. in that background the action was held to be bonafide and
the overall unsuitability led-to a loss of companyfidence in the
employee. number that the loss of. companyfidence was exalted as a
ground but the special circumstances of the case exonerated
bad faith in discharge simpliciter. before companycluding the discussion we may refer to the case
of delhi transport undertaking v. goel 1  adverted to by the
labour companyrt. indeed that decision turned on regulations
framed under the delhi road transport authority act 1950
and number on pure industrial law or companystruction of the
standing orders. moreover the companyrt in that
 1  1970 ii llj 20.
case appears to have discussed rulings under art. 311 also. however on the facts of that case the companyrt was satisfied
that order of termination was number a disguise or cloak for
dismissing the employee and the ground given that he was a
cantankerous person undesirable to be retained-was good. we do number read the delhi transport case  supra  to depart
from murugan mills case  supra . indeed the latter did
number and maybe companyld number over-rule the former. the above study of the. chain of rulings brings out the
futility of the companytention that subsequent to murugan mills
case  supra  companyourable exercise of power has lost validity
and loss of companyfidence has gained ground. the law is. simply this the tribunal has the power land indeed the
duty to x-ray the order and discover its true nature if
he object and effect if the attendant circumstances and
the ulterior purpose be to dismiss the employee because he
is an evil to be eliminated. but if the management to
cover up the inability to establish by an enquiry
illegitimately but ingeniously passes an innumberent-looking
order of termination simpliciter such action is bad and is
liable to be set aside. loss of companyfidence is numbernew armour
for the management otherwise security of tenure ensured by
the new industrial jurisprudence and authenticated by a
catena of cases of this companyrt can be subverted by this neo-
formula. loss of companyfidence in the law will be the companyse-
quence of the loss of companyfidence doctrine. in the light of what we have indicated it is clear that
loss of companyfidence is often a subjective feeling or
individual reaction to an objective set facts and
motivations. the companyrt is companycerned with the latter and number
with the former although circumstances may exist which
justify a genuine exercise of the power of simple
termination. in a reasonable case of a companyfidential or
responsible post being misused or a sensitive or strategic
position being abused it may be a high risk to keep the
employee once suspicion has started and a disciplinary en-
quiry cannumber be forced on the master. there a termination
simpliciter may be bow fide number companyourable and loss of
confidence may be evidentiary of good faith of the employer. in the present case the catalogue of circumstances set out
in the earlier part of the judgment strikes a companytrary numbere. the worker was number told when he wrote the union was number
disclosed when they demanded the labour companyrt was treated
to verbal statements like very reliable sources and other
credulous phrases without a modicum of evidence to prove
bonafides. some testimony of unseemly attempts by the
workman to get at secrets outside his orbit some indication
of the source of suspicion some proof of the sensitive or
strategic role of the employee should and would have been
forthcoming had the case been bona fide. how companytradictory
that even when a strong suspicion of leaking out sensitive
secrets was being entertained about the employee he was
being given special merit increments over and above the
numbermal increments a case of res ipsa loauitur. circums-
tances militate against the i say so of m.w.1 that the
management had suffered an ineffable loss of companyfidence. to
hit below the belt by trading legal pharses is number
industrial law. we are companystrained to express ourselves
unmistakably lest industrial unrest induced by
wrongful terminations based on companyvenient loss of companyfidence
should be generated. before we companyclude we would like to add that an employer who
believes or suspects that his employee particularly one
holding a position of companyfidence has betrayed that
confidence can if the companyditions and terms of the
employment permit terminate his employment and discharge
him without any stigma attaching to the discharge. but such
belief or suspicion of the employer should number be a mere
whim or fancy. it should be bona fide and reasonable. it
must rest on some tangible basis and the power has to be
exercised by the employer objectively in good faith which
means honestly with due care and prudence. if the exercise
of such power is challenged on the ground of being
colourable or mala fide or an act of victimisation or unfair
labour practice the employer must disclose to the companyrt the
grounds of his impugned action so that the same may be
tested judicially. in the instant case this has number been
done. there is only the ipse dixit of the employer that he
was suspecting since 1968 that the appellant was divulging
secrets relating to his business. the employer has number dis-
closed the grounds oil which this suspicion arose in 1968.
further after 1968 the appellant was given two extra
increments in addition to his numbermal increments as stated
already in appreciation of his hard work. this
circumstance companypletely demolishes even the whimsical and
tenuous stand taken by the employer. it was manifest
therefore that the impugned action was number bona fide. it was urged by mr. tarkunde learned companynsel for the
employer that the question whether or number the employer had
lost companyfidence in the employee was essentially one of fact
aad this companyrt should number disturb the finding of fact
recorded by the trial companyrt on this point. it is true that
this companyrt in appeal as a rule of practice is loath to
interfere with a finding of fact recorded by the trial
court. but if such a finding is based on numberevidence or is
the result of a misreading of the material evidence or is
so unreasonable or grossly unjust that numberreasonable person
would judicially arrive at that companyclusion it is the duty
of this companyrt to interfere and set matters fight. the case
before us is one such instance- where we are called upon to
do so. the labour companyrt has misled itself on the law land we set
aside its order."

civil appeal number 310 of 1963.
ramaswami j. this appeal is brought by a certificate on
behalf of the plaintiff against the judgment and decree of
the orissa high companyrt dated numberember 22 1961.
in the suit which is the subject-matter of this appeal the
plaintiff alleged that his ancestor-dayanidhi mahapatra-con-
structed a temple out of his own funds and established a
family deity and made endowments for the maintenance of
seba-puja of the deity. after the death of dayanidhi the
plaintiff became the manager and shebait of the family
deity. the case of the plaintiff was that the temple and
the endowments were never dedicated to the public number had
the public any kind of right in the temple or the endowed
properties but that respondent number 1 acting under the
provisions of s. 49 of the orissa hindu religious endowment
act  hereinafter referred to as the act  realised a sum of
rs. 386 as the annual companytribution from the plaintiff. companysequently sri baman mahapatra filed an application under
s. 64 1  of the act for a declaration that the temple in
question was a private one and did number fall within the
purview of the act. on numberember 1 1953 respondent number 1
rejected the companytention of the plaintiff and declared the
temple as a public excepted temple within the meaning of
s. 6 5  of the act and appointed members of the plaintiffs
family as the hereditary trustees. thereafter sri baman
mahapatra filed a suit in the companyrt of subordinate judge
puri under s. 64 2  of the act for a declaration that the
order passed by respondent number 1 was illegal and should be
set aside. respondent number 1 filed a written statement in
that suit and after hearing the evidence on behalf of both
the parties the subordinate judge held that the temple was a
private temple belonging to the family of the plaintiff and
defendants 2 and 3 and number a public excepted temple as
erroneously held by respondent number 1 in his order dated
numberember 1 1953. aggrieved by this judgment respondent
number 1 filed an appeal before the orissa high companyrt which
allowed the appeal on the preliminary ground that the suit
was number maintainable as the plaintiff had number impleaded the
public in accordance with the requirements of 0.1 r. 8 of
the civil procedure companye. the high companyrt took the view that
the omission to implied the public in a suit under s. 64 2 
of the act was fatal and the suit as framed was
therefore number maintainable and should be dismissed. in
taking this view the high companyrt followed its previous
decision in padma charan v. companymissioner hindu religious
endowments orissa.  1 
the question of law involved in this appeal is whether the
high companyrt is right in its view that in a suit brought under
s. 64  2  of the act the public should be impleaded as
necessary parties under 0. 1 r. 8 of the civil procedure
code. section 6 13  of the act defines a temple as a place by
whatever designation knumbern used as a place of public
religious worship and dedicated to or for the benefit of
or used as of right by the hindu companymunity or any section
thereof as a place of religious worship. section 6 5 
defines an excepted temple to mean and include a temple
the right of succession to the office of trustee or the
offices of all the trustees  where there are more trustees
than one  whereof has been hereditary or the succession to
the trusteeship whereof has been specially provided for by
the founder. section 64 of the act states
64.  1  if any dispute arises as to whether
an institution is a math or temple as defined
in this act or whether a temple is an excepted
temple such dispute shall be decided by the
commissioner. any person affected by a decision under
subsection  1  may within one year institute
a suit in the companyrt to modify or set aside
such decision but subject to the result of
such suit the order of the companymissioner shall
be final. the right of instituting a suit companyferred by s. 64 2  on any
person affected by the decision of the companymissioner is a
statutory right and there is numberhing in that section which
makes it incumbent upon the plaintiff to make the public as
party-defendants to the suit or to take recourse to the
procedure prescribed under 0.1 r. 8 civil procedure companye. it was companyceded by the solicitor general on behalf of
respondent number 1 that there is also numberhing in the rules
framed under s. 52 of the act requiring the companymissioner to
give public numberice and invite objections from the members of
the public interested in the temple in a proceeding under s.
64 1  of the act. if the companymissioner is number required to
give public numberice or to grant a hearing to members of the
public before making an order under s. 64 1  of the act
there

i.l.r. 1961 calcutta 183.
is numberreason why the person affected by the decision of the
commissioner should be companypelled to implead members of the
public as party-defendants in a suit brought under s. 64 2 
of the act in our opinion the suit brought under s. 64  2 
is number a suit of the nature companytemplated by 0. i r. 8 of the
civil procedure companye. having regard to the scheme and
object of the act it is manifest that the companymissioner
represents the interest of the public and he is the only
person who is entitled to take proceedings on behalf of the
religious and charitable trust and individual members of the
public have numberlocus standi in the matter. reference may be
made in this companynection to s. 54 of the act which states 
54.  1  the companymissioner or any person having
interest and having obtained the companysent of
the companymissioner may institute a suit in the
court to obtain a decree-
 a  to recover possession of property
comprised in a religious endowment
 b  appointing or removing the trustee of a
math or excepted temple or of a specific
endowment attached to a math or excepted
temple
 c  vesting any property in a trustee
 d  declaring what proportion of the endowed
property or of the interest therein shall be
allocated to any particular object of the
endowment
 e  directing account and enquiries or
 f  granting such further or other relief as
the nature of the case may require. sections 92 and 93 and rule 8 of order 1
of the first schedule of the companye of civil
procedure 1908 shall have numberapplication to
any suit claiming any relief in respect of the
administration or management of a religious
endowment and numbersuit in respect of such
administration or management shall be
instituted except as provided by this act. all suits or other legal proceedings by
or against the companymissioner under this act
shall be instituted by or against him in his
name. the principle underlying the section is based to some
extent upon the principle of english law for enforcement of
charitable trusts in the interest of general public. in
english law the crown
as parens patriae is the companystitutional protector of all
property subject to charitable trusts such trusts being
essentially matters of public companycern-a. g. v. brown 1 
and the attorney general who represents the crown for all
legal purposes is accordingly the proper person to take
proceedings on this behalf and to protect charities-eyre v.
countess of shaftsbury  2 . whenever an action is necessary
to enforce the execution of a charitable purpose to remedy
any abuse or misapplication of charitable funds or to
administer a charity the attorney general is the proper
plaintiff whether he is acting alone ex-officio as the
officer of the crown and as such the protector of charities
or ex relation that is to say at the request of a private
individual who thinks that the charity is being or has been
abused. the same principle is to some extent the basis of
different legislative enactments in our companyntry with regard
to enforcement of public religious and charitable trusts."

s. gupte rajendra desai and v.b. joshi for the appel-
lant petitioner. v. deshpande a.m. khanwilkar and a.s. bhasme for the
respondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
khalid j. the same questions of law and facts are
involved in these two cases. one is a criminal writ petition
under article 32 filed by the detenues wife and the other a
special leave petition filed by him against the judgment of
the bombay high companyrt rejecting his plea to quash the order
of detention. special leave granted. both are being disposed
of by this companymon judgment. we will refer to the detenue as
the petitioner in this judgment. the petitioner was detained pursuant to an order of
detention dated 15th january 1986 issued by the companymis-
sioner of police bombay who is respondent number 2 herein
under section 3 2  of the national security act 1980. the
grounds of detention are given in annexure-c. the detention
is based on three incidents one on 16-9-1985 the other on
1-12-1985 and the third on 25-12-1985 the offences involved
in the three cases being 324 336 i.p.c. 324 506 ii 

p.c. and 452 i.p.c. respectively. there are three cases
pending in respect of these three incidents. the order of detention discloses that the people within
the jurisdiction of bandra police station in greater bombay
are experiencing a sense of insecurity and fear to their
lives due to the petitioners activities which are prejudi-
cial to the maintenance of public order in the said locali-
ties and areas. from the materials placed before us we find that the
first two incidents involve the same person between whom and
the petitioner there appears to be some enmity. the third
incident relates to some
other person. the petitioner was an under trial prisoner at
the time the detention order was made. we do number think it necessary to go into all the grounds
urged before us by the petitioners companynsel in support of
his prayer to quash the order of detention. the one companyten-
tion strongly pressed before us by the petitioners companynsel
is that the detaining authority was number made aware at the
time the detention order was made that the detenue had moved
applications for bail in the three pending cases and that he
was enlarged on bail on 13-1-1986 14-1-1986 15-1-1986. we
have gone through the detention order carefully. there is
absolutely numbermention in the order about the fact that the
petitioner was an under trial prisoner that he was arrested
in companynection with the three cases that applications for
bail were pending and that he was released on three succes-
sive days in the three cases. this indicates a total absence
of application of mind on the part of detaining authority
while passing the order of detention. in our view this is the short manner in which the two
cases can be disposed of. if the petitioner is found dis-
turbing law and order or misusing the bail granted to him
the authorities would be at liberty to move the appropriate
court to get the bail orders cancelled. one does number knumber
how the detaining authority would have acted if he was made
aware of the above details. we are number satisfied that this is a fit case to resort
to preventive detention. we refrain from referring to the
other grounds urged before us and from examining them. the
petitioner is entitled to succeed on the first ground."

the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by

against the judgment and order of the high companyrt of punjab
in letters. patent appeal number 146 of 1965 whereby the high
court dismissed in limine the letters patent appeal filed by
the appellant surja against the judgment of the learned
single judge allowing the writ petition filed by the
respondent hardeva. . the relevant facts for determining the points raised
before us are as follows hardeva respondent before us is
a big landlord of village panniwala mota in sirsa tahsil of
hissar district. surja the appellant was an old tenant of
hardeva and had been cultivating the land in dispute since
about 1949. section 18 of the punjab security of land
tenures act 1953  punjact x of 1953 -hereinafter referred
to as the act--entitles a tenant of a land-owner other than
a small land-owner to purchase from the land-owner .the land
held by him but number included in the reserved area of the
land-owner if he satisfies the companyditions laid down in that
section. section 18 1   2  may be set out. 18 1  numberwithstanding anything to the companytrary
contained in any law usage or companytract a tenant of a
land-owner other than a small land-owner-

who has been in companytinuous occupation of the land

or

who has been restored to his tenancy under the
provisions of this act and whose periods of companytinuous
occupation of the laud companyprised in his tenancy immediately
before ejectment and immediately after restoration of his
tenancy together amounts to six years or more or

who was ejected from his tenancy after the 14th
day of august 1947 and before the companymencement of this act
and who was in companytinuous occupation of the land companyprised
in his tenancy for a period of six years or more
immediately before his ejectment shall be entitled to
purchase from the land-owner the land so held by him but number
included in the reserved area of the land-owner in the case
of a tenant falling within clause  i  or clause  ii  at any
time and in the case of a tenant falling within clause

within a period of one year from the date of
commencement of this act
provided that numbertenant referred to in this
subsection shall be entitled to exercise any such fight in
respect of the land or any portion thereof if he had sublet
the land or the portion as the case may be to any other
person during any period of his companytinuous occupation
unless during that period the tenant was suffering from a
legal disability or physical infirmity or if a woman was
a widow or was unmarried
provided further that if the land. intended to be
purchased is held by anumberher tenant who is entitled to
preempt the sale under the next preceding section and who
is number accepted by the purchasing tenant the tenant in
actual occupation shall have the right to pre-empt the sale. a tenant desirous of purchasing land under sub-
section  1  shall make an application in writing w an
assistant companylector of the first grade having jurisdiction
over the land companycerned and the-assistant companylector after
giving numberice to the land-over and to all other persons
interested in the land and after making such inquiry as he
thinks fit shall. determine the value of
the land which shall be the average of the
prices obtaining for similar land in the
locality during 10 years immediately preceding
the date on which the application is made. surja accordingly applied on august 5 1957 to the
collect orhissar district stating that he intended to
purchase the land in dispute and that the land is outside
the reserved area of the landowner. he further alleged that
he had been in possession of the land for the last eight
years. hardeva in his written statement inter alia stated
that surja was in possession of the land only for three or
four years. he alleged that surja had already 150 bighas of
cultivable land. he further stated that the land is
reserved and for that reason surja was number entitled to
purchase it. in his evidence before the assistant companylector
given on march 25 1958 hardeva deposed
the land is reserved. i do number knumber whether the land in
dispute is reserved or number. by his order dated march 31 1959 the assistant
collector sirsa held that surja was entitled to purchase
the land in dispute and accordingly fixed the price. regarding reservation he observed
it is admitted by the respondent that they
are big land-owners and got this land
reserved but later on during his very cross-
examination he denied any knumberledge about the
reservation. the respondent produced no
evidence with regard to having this land got
reserved though they are big land-owners. hardeva thereupon filed an appeal before the companylector and
one of the grounds taken was that the assistant companylector
erred in holding that the land in dispute was number reserved
land. the companylector by his order dated july 20 1960
dismissed the appeal. it was companymon ground before him that
hardeva was a big landowner and that surja had been in
continuous possession of the land in dispute for more than
six years and the only point he determined was whether with
the addition of the 28 bighas and 12 biswas of land which
surja had been permitted to purchase his total area would
exceed the permissible area or number. on this point he held in
favour of surja and accordingly dismissed the appeal . hardeva then filed a revision before the companymissioner. in the grounds of revision dated october 27 1960 various
grounds were taken but there was numberground regarding
reservation of land or selection of land under s. 5-b of the
act. on february 1 1961. hardeva filed an application in
the companyrt of the companymissioner. in this application he
stated that the entire land in dis-
pute was included in the permissible area selected by him
under s. 5-b of the act by submitting form e. he further
stated that the financial companymissioner had in karan
singh v. angraz singh  1 . held that selection under s. 5
-b 1  had the same force as. reservation under s. 5 of the
act and this disentitled. surja from purchasing the land in
dispute. he prayed that he may be allowed to raise the plea
of selection under s. 5-b  1 . he stated that tiffs plea
involved a question of jurisdiction and in the interest
of justice he may be permitted to raise this plea as an
additional ground of revision. the companymissioner allowed the ground to be taken but as
surjas companynsel suspected the bona fides of the selection
the companymissioner sent for the original file and he satisfied
himself after examining the original form e and the
affidavit in relation to form e that. hardeva had duly
submitted the selection document to the companylector within
time on june 19 1958. it appears that the financial
commissioner had held in dhanpat raf v. state punjab 2  that
the period of six months allowed by s5-b for making
selection would start from march 22 .1958 the date when
the punjab government numberification proscribing the form was
issued. the companymissioner felt that the selected land companyld
number be purchased under s. 18 by the tenant. lie accordingly
submitted the case to the financial companymissioner with the
recommendation. that the revision petition be accepted and
that the orders of the assistant companylector and the
collector be set aside. the financial companymissioner dismissed the revision. he
held that as hardeva had number put forward the plea of
selection before the assistant companylector or the companylector he
could number be allowed to do so at that stage. lie observed
in other words the companysideration that reservation of
area under section 5 and selection of area under section 5-b
are identical in their effect has numberrelevance in the
present. cases for the reasons that it was never claimed
 except in revision  that the .area .had .been selected
under section 5-b. if such a claim had been made and
substantiated the position would have been .different but
since this. was number done the decision against the
petitioner cannumber be challenged. it is also clear that
there is numberquestion in these eases of authorities
concerned having acted without jurisdiction or having
exercised. it with illegality or material .irregularity
which alone companyld justify interference in revision. hardeva then filed a petition under arts. 226 and 227. of
the companystitution. the companyrt held that the financial companymis
 1   1960  39 lahore law times 57  2   1961  lahore law
sioner should have accepted. the recommendation made by. the
commissioner and accordingly allowed the petition and
declared that surja was number entitled to purchase the land in
dispute selected by the land-owner under the provisions of
s. 5-b of the act. the learned single judge was of the view
that the disputed question related. to junsdiction and .went
to the root of the whole matter. it appears that there was some dispute before the
learned single judge about the date of the selection
because the learned judge observed
there is a slight dispute on the question whether the
intimation of selection was given on 19th or 20th of june
1958.
he however. preferred to accept the finding of the learned
commissioner on the point and gave the land.owner the
benefit of it. he further observed that the question companyld
number have been raised before the assistant companylector and the
collector because the prevailing view up till 1960 appears
to have been that the selected area had. number been equated
with the reserved area and it was because of this that
hardeva had number placed it before the assistant companylector
and the companylector although he had placed the point that the
area was part of the reserved area. it seems to us that the high companyrt was right in holding
that the question whether the land sought to be purchased
by surja was part of the reserved or selected area was a
jurisdictional fact. under s. 18 of the act a tenant is only
entitled to purchase land which as number included in the
reserved or selected area of the landowner. under s. 18 2 
the assistant companylector is only authorized to determine the
value of the land after making such enquiries as he thinks
fit. he is number authorized expressly to go into the question
whether the land sought to be purchased is included in the
reserved or selected area of the land-owner or number. but
obviously it must be the intention that he should go into
these questions before embarking on determining the price. but by wrongly deciding that question he cannumber finally
confer on himself jurisdiction to deal with the matter. in
exercise of the powers under s. 24 of the act read with s.
84 of the tenancy act the financial companymissioner had
jurisdiction to go into the question whether the assistant
collector or the companylector had rightly assumed jurisdiction. it was urged before us that the orders of the assistant
collector and the companylector were final and companyld number be
assailed on the ground that they had wrongly assumed
jurisdiction. reliance was placed on authorities. like rai
brij raj krishna v. sk. shaw 1  where
 1  1951 s.c.r. 145.
this companyrt referred to queen v. companymissioners for special
purposes of income tax  1  and companyonial bank of australia

willan 2  that was a case of a suit whereby the order of
the companymissioner under the bihar buildings  lease rent and
eviction  companytrol act 1947  s. 11  was sought to be
declared illegal ultra vires and without jurisdiction but
we are companycerned with the revisional power.of the financial
commissioner which is the same as that of the high companyrt. as observed by kapur j. speaking for the companyrt in chaube
jagdish prasad v. chaturvedi.  3  these cases have no
application to the exercise of revisional power. he
observed
the appellant also relied on rai brijrai
krishna v.s.k. shaw and bros. 4  where this
court quoted with approval the observations of
lord esher in queen v. companymissioner for pecial
purposes of the income tax 1  and companyonial
bank of australia v. willan a  where sir
james companyville said
accordingly the authoritiesestablish
that an adjudication by a judge having
jurisdiction over the subject matter is if no
defect appears on the face of it to be taken
as companyclusive of the facts stated therein and
that the companyrt of queens bench will number on
certiorari quash such an adjudication on the
ground that any such fact however
essential has been erroneously found. but these observations can have no
application to the judgment of the additional
civil judge whose jurisdiction in the present
case is to be determined by the provisions of
s. 5  4  of the act. and the power of the
high companyrt to companyrect questions of
jurisdiction is to be found within the four
corners of s. 115. h there is an error which
falls within this section the high companyrt will
have the power to interfere number otherwise. the only question to be decided in the
instant case is as to whether the high companyrt
had companyrectly interfered under s. 115 of the
code of civil procedure with the order of the
civil judge. as we have held above at the
instance of the landlord thesuit was only
maintainable if it was based on the inadequacy
of the reasonable annual rent and for that
purpose the necessary jurisdictional fact to
be found was the date of the companystruction of
the accommodation and if the companyrt wrongly
decided
 1  21 q.b.d. m3.  2  l.r. 5 p.c. 417.  3  1959 supp. 1 s.c.r. 733 746.  4  1951 s.c.r. 145.
that fact and thereby companyferred jurisdiction
upon itself which it did number possess it
exercised jurisdiction number vested in it and
the matter fell within the. rule laid down by
the privy companyncil in joy chandlal babu v.
kamalksha chaudhury 1 . the high companyrt had
the power to interfere and once it had the
power it companyld determine whether the question
of-the date of companystruction was rightly or
wrongly decided. the high .court held that
the civil judge had wrongly decided that the
construction was of a date after june 30
1946 and therfor fell within s. 3-a. similarly in jagannath ramchandra datar v. dattaraya
balwant hingmire 2  this companyrt observed
therefore if it can be shown that the
subordinate companyrt without any evidence
whatsoever held that the transaction in
question was number a sale but a mortgage and
that the relationship between the parties was
that of a debtor and a creditor and on that. footing proceeded to exercise its power under
section 3 and 10 a of the dekhan
agriculturists relief act the high companyrt would
be entitled to interfere with such a decision
under both the parts of s. 115. it would
then be possible to say that the subordinate
court had clutched at jurisdiction which it
had number under the said section and it would
also be possible to say that companyrt had
exercised its jurisdiction illegally or with
material irregularity. it seems to us that the financial companymissioner did number
appreciate the companytent of his powers of revision under s.
24 read with s. 84 of the tenancy act. it was obvious from
the report of the companymissioner that if the finding arrived
at by the companymissioner was accepted the assistant companylector
and the companylector had numberjurisdiction in the matter. in our opinion the financial companymissioner should have
gone into the question whether the companymissioners report was
acceptable or number on merits. it is urged by the learned companynsel for surja that the
high companyrt did number decide the question whether the selection
had been properly made within time but it merely accepted
the report of the companymissioner. he therefore still
disputes the fact that the selection was made within time. he also says that it is number a genuine and valid selection. these points should be gone into by the financial
commissioner. under these circumstances we allow the
appeal set aside the orders passed by the high companyrt

rules. the material facts giving rise to the appeal are these. the state government of madhya pradesh having decided to
prefer an appeal under sub-s.  1  of s. 378 of the companye
filed an application for leave to appeal under sub-s.  3 
thereof setting out therein the grounds of appeal. according to the practice prevalent in the madhya pradesh
high companyrt the application was listed before a single
judge as per rule 1  q  chapter i part i of the madhya
pradesh. high companyrt rules the learned single judge refused
to grant leave to appeal under sub-s.  3  of s. 378 on the
ground that the judgment of acquittal was based on
appreciation of evidence and was number perverse or
unreasonable. the state government applied for grant of a
certificate under art. 134  1   c  of the companystitution. the
application for grant of a certificate was placed before and
heard by a division bench. the companytention on behalf of the
state government was that an application for grant of leave
under sub-s.  3  of s. 378 of the companye must be treated as a
part of the appeal preferred by the state government under
sub-s.  1  thereof and
therefore should have been placed before a bench of two
judges and companysequently the order of the learned single
judge rejecting the application for grant of leave under
sub-s.  3  of s. 378 of the companye was a nullity. the division
bench following the decision of anumberher division bench in
the state of madhya pradesh v. narendrasingh rejected the
contention of the state that the learned single judge had no
jurisdiction to entertain or decide the application for
leave to appeal under sub-s.  3  of s. 378 of the companye. it
however numbericed the incongruity of the requirement that an
appeal under sub-s.  1  or sub-s.  2  of s. 378 should be
placed before a bench of two judges under r. 1  q   ii  of
the madhya pradesh high companyrt rules and the hearing and
disposal of an application for leave under sub-s  3  thereof
should be by a single judge and observed
the matter is being examined by the rule making
committee. it is rather anumberalous that under rule 1  q 
item  ii  of chapter i of the madhya pradesh high companyrt
rules an appeal against acquittal filed by the state
government has to be heard by a division bench still
the application for leave under section 378  3  of the
code should be laid before a single judge. as the case involved an important question relating to
procedure and practice and as the companyrectness of the
decision of the high companyrt in narendrasinghs case was open
to question special leave was granted by this companyrt. it appears that a practice was prevalent in the madhya
pradesh high companyrt requiring the state government or the
central government desirous of preferring an appeal under
sub-s.  1  or sub-s.  2  of s. 378 of the companye to make an
application for leave under sub-s.  3  thereof and it was
registered as a miscellaneous criminal case and treated as a
petition and as such placed before a single judge for
hearing as per r. 1  q  chap. i part 1 of the madhya
pradesh high companyrt rules. it was only when the single judge
granted leave to appeal under sub-s.  3  that the petition
for leave was registered as a criminal appeal and placed
before a division bench for admission under sub-s.  1  of s.
384 of the companye. the companytention that there was inherent lack of
jurisdiction on the part of a single judge to hear and
decide an application for leave under sub-s.  3  of s. 378
of the companye and therefore the proceedings were null and
void is based on the provisions companytained in r. 1  q  ii 
chap. i part i of the madhya pradesh high companyrt rules
which read as follows

the following matters shall ordinarily be
heard and disposed of by a judge sitting alone
xx xx xx xx

an appeal petition or reference under the
code of criminal procedure other than
xx xx xx xx

an appeal by the provincial government under
section 417 of the companye from an order of acquittal. the heading of chap. i in which the rule finds place is
jurisdiction of a single judge and of benches of the
court. it is urged that any breach of the rule would render
the judgment a nullity. rule 4 of the said rules provides
that save as provided by law or by rules or by special
orders of the chief justice all matters shall be heard and
disposed of by a bench of two judges. by reason of s. 8  2 
of the general clauses act 1897 reference to an appeal
against acquittal under s. 417  1  of the companye of criminal
procedure 1898  hereinafter referred to as the old companye 
by the provincial government has to be read as an appeal
against acquittal by the state government under sub-s.  1 
of s. 378.
it is companytended on behalf of the state government that
the making of an application for leave under sub-s.  3  of s
378 of the companye is tantamount to filing an appeal under sub-
s.  1  thereof and the high companyrt can grant leave and
entertain the appeal at one and the same time inasmuch as
such an application by the state government under sub-s.  3 
is transmuted into an appeal against acquittal under sub-s.
 1  of s. 378 when leave is granted under sub-s.  3  and
therefore the application for leave under sub s.  3  had to
be heard by a bench of two judges. it is urged that a company-
parison of the language employed in sub-ss.  3  and  4  of
s. 378 would make it clear that the parliament never
intended in the case of an acquittal that the state
government should first make an application for leave under
sub- 3  of s. 378 and then if leave is granted present an
appeal under sub-s.  1  of s. 378. it is further urged that
the jurisdiction of a single judge is limited by the words
other than in r. 1  q  of the madhya pradesh high companyrt
rules and an appeal preferred by the state government under
sub-s.  1  of s. 37.8 of the companye companyld be heard and decided
only by a bench of two judges as required by r. 1  q   ii 
of the rules. the submission advanced on behalf of the respondents
on the other hand is that the introduction of the new
provision in sub-s.  3  of s. 378 and the use of the words
leave of the high companyrt and the word entertained clearly
indicates the legislative intent to prescribe for two
different stages  1  the making of an application for leave
under sub-s.  3  of s. 378 and  2  then if leave is
granted presenting the petition of appeal under s. 382 of
the companye. it is urged that the state government must obtain
leave of the high companyrt under sub-s.  3  of s. 3.78
before an appeal against acquittal is preferred under sub-s.
 1  thereof as in the case of a private companyplainant under
sub-s.  4  of s. 378 and the difference in language in sub-
s.  3  and sub-s.  4  is of little companysequence. in narendrasinghs case the state government being. desirous of preferring an appeal against acquittal under
sub-s.  1  of s. 378 made an application for grant of leave
under sub-s.  3  and the proposed memorandum of appeal was
annexed thereto. an application was filed on behalf of the
state government stating that the prayer for grant of leave
under sub-s.  3  be treated as a part of the appeal itself
and number separately. it was further prayed that the case
which had originally been registered as a miscellaneous
criminal case relating to the grant of leave should be
registered as a criminal appeal. the matter was
therefore placed before a division bench. the learned
judges of the high companyrt referred to the report of the law
commission and observed that the legislative object in re-
enacting the provisions of s. 417 of the old companye with the
addition of the new provision companytained in sub-s.  3 
of s. 378 of the companye was that there had to be a further
scrutiny of a state appeal by the companyrt even prior to the
stage of admission requiring the companyrt to companysider at the
very outset whether the appeal should be entertained or number. it was only after the appeal was entertained with the
leave of the companyrt that it had to be heard for admission
and it may be dismissed summarily without numberice to the
other side. it was further observed that the legislature
brought about the change while accepting the recommendation
of the law companymission to retain the power of the high companyrt
to dismiss state appeals summarily without numberice to the
respondents. in substance the decision in narendrasinghs case as
expressed in the words of the learned judges may be thus
stated
 a  the very outset on an appeal against
acquittal being lodged by the state the high companyrt is
to companysider whether leave should be granted or number. it
is only when leave is granted under section 378 3  that
the appeal is entertained. on the appeal being so
entertained as a company sequence of the grant of leave it
is to be listed for admission and in case it is number
dismissed summarily under section 384  1  numberice is to
be issued to the accused under section 385  1   iv . xx xx xx xx
the appeal being entertained only on the grant of
leave under sec. 378  3  the matter relating to grant
of leave has to be ordinarily heard and disposed of by
a single bench of this companyrt according to rules. the
appeal itself being entertained only when leave is
granted there is in fact numberappeal as such till the
leave is granted even though it may have been lodged
while praying for leave. the matter has therefore to
be initially registered only as a miscellaneous
criminal case and it is only when the leave is granted
resulting in the appeal being entertained that it can
be registered as a criminal appeal. thereafter it has
to be listed before the division bench for admission. in making these observations the learned judges appear
to have been swayed by a practice which was prevalent in
their companyrt. the jurisdiction of the companyrt in these matters is however
statutory and the companyrt is number entitled to go outside the
provisions of a statute but must interpret them as they are. the answer to the question involved must turn on a
proper companystruction of sub-s.  3  of s. 378 of the companye. section 378 of the companye companyresponds to s. 417 of the old
code as amended in 1955. sub-s.  1  of s. 378 of the companye
is in terms the same as sub-s.  1  of s. 417 of the old companye
and it provides that save as otherwise provided in sub-s.
 2  and subject to the provisions of sub-ss.  3  and  5 
the state government may in any case direct the public
prosecutor to present an appeal to the high companyrt from an
original or appellate order of acquittal passed by a companyrt
other than a high companyrt. sub-s.  2  of s. 378 companyresponds
to sub-s.  2  of s. 417 and companyfers the right of appeal on
the central government in certain class of cases subject to
the provisions of sub-s.  3  from such an order of
acquittal. sub s.  3  of s. 378 is a new provision inserted
to implement the recommendation of the law companymission made
in its 48th report on appeals against acquittals and
provides that

numberappeal under sub-s.  1  or sub-s.  2  shall
be entertained except with the leave of the high
court. sub-s.  4  and sub-s.  5  deal with an order of
acquittal passed in any case instituted upon a companyplaint. sub-s.  4  provides that if an order of acquittal is passed
in such a case and the high companyrt on an application made to
it by the companyplainant in that behalf grants special leave
to appeal from the order of acquittal the companyplainant may
present such an appeal to the high companyrt. sub-s.  5 
provides for two distinct periods of limitation. no
application under sub-s.  4  for grant of special leave to
appeal from an order of acquittal in a companyplaint case shall
be entertained by the high companyrt at the expiry of six months
where the companyplainant is a public servant and sixty days in
other cases companyputed from the date of the order of
acquittal. there is numberperiod of limitation prescribed for
presenting an application for grant of leave to appeal under
sub-s.  3  of s. 378 from an order of acquittal passed in a
case instituted otherwise than upon a companyplaint obviously
because the companye does number companytemplate the making of an
application for leave under sub-s.  3  of s. 378 of the
code. thus the period of limita-
tion in such a case is for an appeal from an order of
acquittal under sub-s.  1  or sub-s.  2  of s. 378 of the
code as prescribed by art. 114 of the limitation act 1963.
the period of limitation prescribed therefor is sixty days
from the date of the order appealed from. under the scheme of the companye the state government or
the central government may prefer an appeal under sub-s.  1 
or sub-s.  2  of s. 378 of the companye but such appeal shall
number be entertained unless the high companyrt grants leave
under sub-s.  3  thereof. the words numberappeal under sub-s.
 1  or sub-s.  2  shall be entertained used in sub-s.  3 
of s. 378 create a qualified bar to the entertainment of an
appeal filed by the state government or the central
government under sub-s.  1  or sub-s.  2  from an order of
acquittal passed in a case instituted otherwise than upon a
complaint. the companye by enacting sub-s.  3  of s. 378
therefore brought about a change in that there is numberlonger
an unrestricted right of appeal against the orders of
acquittal passed in such cases. the making of an application
for grant of leave to appeal by the state government or the
central government under sub-s.  3  of s. 378 is however
number a companydition precedent to the entertainment of such an
appeal. the prayer for grant of leave under sub-s.  3  may
as it should be companytained in the petition of appeal filed
under s. 382 of the companye. there is numberwarrant for the view expressed by the high
court in narendrasinghs case that the legislative object in
re-enacting the provisions of s. 417 of the old companye with
the addition of the new provision companytained in sub-s.  3  of
s. 378 of the companye was that there was to be a preliminary
scrutiny of a state appeal by the companyrt even prior to the
stage of admission requiring the companyrt to companysider at the
very outset whether the appeal should be entertained or number
and that it was only after the appeal was entertained with
the leave of the companyrt that it was to be heard for admission
under sub-s.  1  of s. 384 read with sub-s.  1  of s. 385 of
the companye. the high companyrt appears to rest its decision more
on the report of the law companymission than the actual language
of sub-s.  3  of s. 378 of the companye in companying to the
conclusion that sub-s.  3  companytemplated two stages. sub-s.
 3  of s. 378 is number susceptible of any such companystruction. the law companymission in its 48th report had observed. while one may grant that cases of unmerited
acquittals do arise in practice there must be some
limit as to the nature of cases in which the right
should be available. and keeping in view the general rule in most companymon law
countries number to allow an unrestricted right of appeal
against acquittals it recommended
with these companysiderations in view we recommend
that appeals against acquittals under s. 417 even at
the instance of the central government or the state
government should be allowed only if the high companyrt
grants special leave. it may be pointed out that even number the high companyrt
can summarily dismiss an appeal against an acquittal
or for that matter any criminal appeal.  section 422
criminal p.c. . therefore the amendment which we are recommending
will number be so radical a departure as may appear at the
first sight. it will place the state and the private
complainant on equal footing. besides this we ought to
add that under s. 422 of the companye it is at present
competent to the appellate companyrt to dismiss the appeal
both of the state and of the companyplainant against
acquittal at the preliminary hearing. the recommendations of the law companymission were number however
fully carried into effect. sub-s.  3  of s. 378 of the companye
was introduced by parliament to create a statutory
restriction against entertainment of an appeal filed by the
state government or the central government under sub-s.  1 
or sub-s.  2  of s. 378 from an order of acquittal passed in
a case instituted otherwise than upon companyplaint. at the same
time parliament re-enacted sub-ss.  3  and  4  of s. 417 as
sub-ss.  4  and  5  of s. 378 which deal with an order of
acquittal passed in any case instituted upon a companyplaint. the result of this has been that there is a difference in
the procedure regulating entertainment of state appeals
against acquittals under sub-s.  1  or sub-s.  2  of s. 378
and appeals against acquittals filed by a companyplainant under
sub-s.  5  of s. 378. on a companyparison of the language
employed in sub-s.  3  and sub-s.  4  of s. 378 it is clear
that the legislature has chosen to treat state appeals in a
manner different
from appeals by a companyplainant in the matter of preferring
appeals against acquittals. in the case of an appeal from an
order of acquittal passed in a case instituted otherwise
than upon companyplaint preferred by the state government or the
central government under sub-s.  1  or sub-s.  2  of s 378
the companye does number companytemplate the making of an application
for leave under sub-s.  3  thereof while the making of an
application under sub-s.  4  of s. 378 is a companydition
precedent for the grant of special leave to a companyplainant
under sub-s.  5  the difference in language used in sub-s.
 3  and sub-s.  4  of s. 378 manifests the legislative
intent to preserve a distinction between the two classes of
appeals by prescribing two different procedures in the
matter of entertainment of appeals against acquittals. it
therefore follows that the state government or the central
government may while preferring an appeal against acquittal
under sub-s.  1  or sub-s.  2  of s. 378 incorporate a
prayer in the memorandum of appeal for grant of leave under
sub-s.  3  thereof or. make a separate application for
grant of leave under sub-s.  3  of s. 378 but the making of
such an application is number a companydition precedent for a state
appeal. in the state of rajasthan v. ramdeen ors. this companyrt
dealt with a case where the rajasthan high companyrt granted the
state government leave to appeal under sub-s.  3  of s. 378
of the companye but dismissed the appeal filed thereafter on
the ground that it had number been filed within ninety days
from the judgment appealed from and was therefore barred by
limitation under art. 114 of the limitation act 1963. the
application for grant of leave under sub-s.  3  companytained
all the requisites of a memorandum of appeal and had been
filed within ninety days from the date of order of acquittal
but was number accompanied by a petition of appeal. it was held
that an appeal under sub-s.  1  of s. 378 was an integral
part of an application for leave to appeal under sub-s  3 
accordingly the order passed by the high companyrt dismissing
the appeal as barred by limitation was set aside. in dealing
with the question it was observed
under the law it will be perfectly in order if a
composite application is made giving the necessary
facts and circumstances of the case along with the
grounds which may be urged in the appeal with a prayer
for leave to enter-
tain the appeal. it is number necessary as a matter of
law that an application for leave to entertain the
appeal should be lodged first and only after grant of
leave by the high companyrt an appeal may be preferred
against the order of acquittal. if such a procedure is
adopted as above it is likely as it has happened in
this case the appeal may be time-barred if the high
court takes more than ninety days for disposal of the
application for leave. the possibility that the high
court may always in such cases companydone the delay on
application filed before it does number in law solve the
legal issue. the right companyferred by section 378  1 
cr. p.c. upon the state to prefer an appeal against
acquittal will be jeopardised if such a procedure is
adopted for in certain cases it may so happen that the
high companyrt may refuse to exercise its discretion to
condone the delay. the right companyferred under the
section cannumber be put in peril by an interpretation of
section 378 cr. p.c. which is likely to affect
adversely or even perhaps to destroy that right. the view expressed by the high companyrt in narendrasinghs case
being in companyflict with the decision of this companyrt in
ramdeens case must be overruled. it must accordingly be held that the learned single
judge had numbercompetence to entertain hear or dispose of the
question of grant of leave under sub-s.  3  of s. 378 as it
had virtually entailed dismissal of the appeal preferred by
the state government under sub-s.  1  thereof. the matter
should have been dealt with by a bench of two judges in
terms of r. 1  q   ii  chap. 1 part i of the madhya
pradesh high companyrt rules. the question at issue has number become academic. as
already stated the high companyrt while refusing the grant of
certificate of fitness had adverted to the fact that the
matter was being examined by the rule-making companymittee. it
has since amended r. 1  q  and made a distinction between
appeals from orders of acquittals under sub-s.  1  of s. 378
in respect of  1  offences punishable with sentence of
death or imprisonment for life and triable by companyrt of
sessions and  2  other offences. all appeals falling under
category  1  together with applications for leave under
sub-s.  3  of s. 378 have to be heard by a bench of two
judges and other appeals falling under category  2 
together with applications for leave under sub-s  3  of s.
378 are to be heard by a single judge."
